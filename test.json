    "complaint_what_happened": "XX/XX/XXXX I was approached by XXXX Attorney XXXX, located in XXXX CA, who claimed to be representing GE/Stein Mart, a credit card company from whom I had a credit card. I contacted XXXX requesting information on the debt, specifically invoices from the pro ported credit card showing purchases, payments and other information. The initial letter was sent XX/XX/XXXX. A follow up letter was sent XX/XX/XXXX after receiving no response to the first. I have yet to receive the information requested pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act 1681s-2 and the Fair Debt Credit Protection Act. Last month I was rejected for a refinancing of my mortgage by the current mortgage holder, XXXX XXXX XXXX, in part due to this negative item on my report. This card, like several others, incurred a drastic increase in interest without notice and without cause in XXXX. I believe this was caused by a bankruptcy I filed that DID NOT INCLUDE ANY CREDIT CARD DEBT. I never missed or was late on a payment but multiple credit card companies increased the interest rate without notice or cause. I paid the increased interest for one or two years without realizing they had increased the rate. I have filed complaints with the CFPB and the other card holders on other creditors who did the same thing over the the same period and in at least one case the account was removed from my credit reports because it was found that the amount due was drastically incorrect when considering the overpayment of interest. In fact, the credit issuer owed me money. I am certain this credit card falls into the same circumstance but have been unable to get a response so I can perform the calculations to support my claim. I am including calculation of similar instances from another credit card company as an example of what I am certain is the case with this credit card. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "XX/XX/XXXX I retired. I invested {$200000.00} in an oil exploration firm XX/XX/XXXX. The investment went sideways due to fraud XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I was in poor financial condition and started job hunting ; I was hired by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. At that time I retained \" XXXX XXXX '' to try and clean up my debts without filing bankruptcy and began paying so much a month ( {$780.00} ) to build up an account to pay the debts and legal fees. We had progressed well and settled a portion of the debts I had incurred. XX/XX/XXXX I XXXX at work ( Workman 's Comp reduced income to XXXX ) and was out until XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX we started hearing from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) through the XXXX District Court of Utah and XXXX XXXX XXXX. For every submittal by XXXX, XXXX XXXX countered with their own court submittal. This went back and forth 4 or 5 times until XX/XX/XXXX with several conversations of settlement. XXXX was very abrasive and cursed at the XXXX XXXX people trying to settle the case, he would not settle. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ( lied, said I never responded to the court ) ) convinced or bought this judge to put a judgement in on me, without my day in court and any arbitration. Per the contract I was to have my arbitration and a day in court. XXXX told XXXX XXXX that I no longer had a contract because these carpet baggers had bought this debt so they were no longer responsible for the stipulations of the contract. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX tried again to settle and offered everything I had in the account ( {$11000.00} ) they said no and cursed them out again and said they want it all. In the same month we submitted paperwork to XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX but XXXX did n't even respond, he ignored both arbitrations attempts. XX/XX/XXXX I found out they had garnished my pay check at XXXX but also my Utah state tax return was taken. XX/XX/XXXX the tax return was a {$3200.00} ( a write off because of the oil loss ), so they have garnished approximately {$7500.00} XX/XX/XXXX.XX/XX/XXXX they will take approximately {$9000.00} but not State tax return because the oil relief is over and now I owe money this year. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX was shut down and investigated by Fed 's for taking to much in fees up front and additional fees throughout each settlement process. Now the garnishing continues my money is tied up ( to settle ) at XXXX XXXX and I still have a corrupt lawyer and Judge to contend with day in day out. I had an original amount of {$20000.00}. The oil fraud was turned over to the Utah Commission and determined they were fraudulent and I filed an additional complaint against XXXX XXXX after finding they had over charged everyone beyond the normal fee structure. The only thing I know is lawyers are created to prey on other peoples misfortunes and make them pay and pay whether or not they say they are on your side. I have all the documentation sent to me and everything I submitted in return. I also have the court records that show no notice of a hearing and no chance to arbitrate a settlement, I 'm discussed. \n",

Our credit cards, which we have had with Bank of America without incident, have bee used to fraudulently charge XXXX of dollars. While most institutions have worked with us to remove these charges from our account, BofA refuses to remove XXXX from the XXXX, XXXX statement. \nI am a XXXX year old retiree and my wife suffers from XXXX. My wife is the principle cardholder, and been unable to use a computer for the past 3 years. As the frauds were occurring, BofA never notified us, even though we had never made charges in these amounts in 30 years. In fact the charges were well above our established credit limits. \nOur daughter XXXX is also a signatory to our account. When questioned XXXX freely admitted that she had shared the passcode with her fiance, and only her fiance. BofA is claiming that this makes us responsible. All of us, including the fiance, will agree to submit to a polygraph anywhere and anytime. Texas state law limits our liabiity to {$50.00} for credit card, and {$500.00} for cash withdraw. \n\nDuring initial conversations with BofA my daughter and I determined which charges were fraud, they agreed that the charges look fraudulent and would remove. In 30 years I had never been late on a payment, and with the understanding that the charges would be removed, I paid the bill in its entirety. At this age I wanted to be sure my credit remained spotless. \nOur community is outraged over the egregious manner we have been treated. In fact, through a neighbor, the local XXXX affiliate has inquired about doing a human interest story on our plight. \nAgain in XXXX we were again victimized on our new BofA card for {$51000.00}. Again they never made a single phone call to us, in spite of our historically low charges and the problem we had in XXXX. \nI am a friend of XXXX and am helping him with this report. My name is XXXX XXXX, and I have know this couple for over 30 years, and know them to be above reproach. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "I am a XXXX veteran with a service connected 90 % XXXX rating. Last year in XXXX we went looking for a new home. For two years, I had been working on my credit reports. I repaired a lot of issues and once my scores went above the required XXXX, my wife and I went home shopping. Across the street from our church and daughters school was a new home subdivision just going in. It was being built and constructed by XXXX. In XXXX of 2015 we found our home and through XXXX, contacted the mortgage company called UAMC ( Universal American Mortgage Company ). They immediately approved us and we signed a contract to build on XXXX XXXX, 2015. We put down a {$500.00} binder for this VA home loan. We were so excited. My family got to put the SOLD sign in the dirt, on our very own lot!! We were just the fifth family to sign a contract. The only home in the neighborhood was the model home and a couple of foundations that had been laid. They told us that our house would be finished in XXXX of 2015. UAMC and XXXX both send me contracts to sign. They go over the credit terms and tell me to absolutely not do anything with my credit. That I was not to make any changes without calling them first. \nSo shortly after all of this, XXXX informs me that I have a 'credit specialist ' assigned to me from UAMC XXXX She will repair what 's left on my credit to get my score even higher for closing. Her name is *private*. This way, I can have an even better interest rate. I agreed happily because that sounded awesome. \nSo, Later in XXXX of 2015, homes started going up all over. XXXX started building like crazy. We were told that the building on our home would start soon. My wife drove through the neighborhood every single day. Waiting and hoping for construction to start. Nothing happened to our dirt lot until late XXXX of 2015. That 's right! They did n't start building until the time they told us our home would originally be finished. They framed the foundation, poured it and started building. Then it stopped. Sat there, all while other homes were being built like crazy. Now, homes are being finished and people started moving in. All while I constantly asked about ours and was told that the building manager will meet with us soon. That the delay of our home was this reason or that reason. I actually called them on XXXX the excuses, because I checked it out for myself and found that I had been lied to. They had told me it was the permitting office. That it takes them forever in XXXX XXXX XXXX. So I went and checked for myself. I was told it had n't even been submitted yet. Oh, and when it was submitted, it only took the department a little over a week to approve it. \nNow the middle of XXXX comes, and I get a call from XXXX. They want to show us another home because they want to close before the end of the year to make their numbers. They framed it as we want to make you happy, since your home is not done yet. Let us show you these other homes. Then it all works out for each of us. So they show us a more expensive home and then a cheaper and smaller home. They tried to tell me that I should go for the cheap smaller home and just work my way up into the big expensive ones. I declined because it was n't large enough and we did n't like it. They ended up declining me for the more expensive home and left me in the original home. Saying that it will be done eventually. \nEarly XXXX comes, and I get a call from UAMC. Calling to inform me that my credit is no longer approved because my score has dropped, and that a new collection has been added to my credit. So, my credit is no longer approved and I would need another XXXX four months to repair the damage. She said she had also spoken with XXXX and that it was fine, because the house was now projected to finish around that same time. What???? SEE ATTACHED FOR FULL COMPLAINT \n",

They did n't just modify my original loan, they did a cashout ( the funds from XXXX mtg payoff ). The only way it would be a modification is if they did n't add the extra funds to MY account. \nSince I never received ANY TIL materials, or even an accounting for the extra money, I am exercising my 3 rear right of rescission, which I originally notified the XX/XX/XXXX. \nIf the refinance that they call a modification was really just a modification, they would be right, but the refinance occurred on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and I am well within the 3 year window to rescind. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "In XXXX 2015, I completed an application requesting mortgage assistance from US Bank due to a financial hardship. After 20 years on the job, my company had a massive layoff and I became unemployed. I fell behind on my mortgage payments with US Bank and applied for mortgage assistance. I submitted all documents requested, and was assigned to a Relationship Manager. A few weeks later I received a call from my Relationship Manager requesting additional documentation to process my request for assistance. According to the Relationship Manager, the underwriter, was requesting a letter from my employer to verify my employment, a current mortgage statement for my properties, a Homeowner Insurance Declaration page, a 2015 tax bill, XXXX recent bank statements and the Homeowners Association Fee ( if applicable ). She also stated that if my property is a rental, I need to send a current lease, with XXXX recent bank statements and circle the rental deposits or send canceled checks. Please note, this property is not a rental, it is my primary residence so I was taken back by their request but I immediately complied and submitted all documents via fax and email. To ensure that my application was complete and to avoid any future discrepancies regarding my rentals, I circled the rental deposits on the bank statements to show proof of my rental income as stated upon my application and advised by the Relationship Manager. Shortly thereafter, the Relationship Manager called me again, requesting the exact same documents again. Once again, I submitted the documents and waited to hear back from US Bank. \nApproximately XXXX weeks later, my Relationship Manager notified me again, that she needed the mortgage statements, another letter of employment clarifying the gift card payouts stating the frequency of how often gift cards are paid out, and a copy of the 2015 tax bill. I complied and resubmitted the documents, my employer wrote another letter stating the frequency of gift card pay outs and I resubmitted the mortgage statements and 2015 tax bill. Now that I have submitted these documents XXXX times, I did not think it would be long before I received an updated status on my application. However on or around XXXX XXXX, 2015 I received a call from my Relationship Manager, stating that they need another copy of my mortgage statement because it is not in the file. Since I had submitted the mortgage statements XXXX times already I could not understand why it would not be in the file, but I complied and sent it again via email and fax. Due to the poor mishandling of my file over the past month and a fast approaching deadline of XXXX XXXX, 2015 to have my documents evaluated by an underwriter, I made the request that US Bank reply, by letting me know they have all documents since I have submitted new documents XXXX times already. I received a response that all documents had been received and the file was now with an underwriter. On, or around the XXXX week in XXXX, I received a call that my file had been denied since I failed to submit mortgage statements as requested. I was absolutely appalled since I had resubmitted these documents XXXX times already. So while on the phone, I requested that the US Bank representative review my file because the mortgage statements should be there. After going through my file, he quickly located the mortgage statements, apologized and stated he would resubmit my file and call me back in 24 hours. I never heard back from him so I called back. I spoke to another representative who also confirmed my file was denied since I failed to submit my mortgage statements. I explained the situation and the file was forwarded a supervisor, who escalated the file back to underwriting. Due to the poor negligence in handling my file, I want the CFPB to conduct a thorough investigation in the practices of US Bank and how I was treated. \n",

But others are miscommunicating the term \" correctly reporting on your credit file '' which not true! Now - today - Bank of America has stripped their own computers of the furnished payment information in each month in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX ; such that the bank 's responders to disputes ca n't see what they furnished in XX/XX/XXXX that is still on my credit report. Bank of America fabricated phony credit card statements to show the XX/XX/XXXX closing by me. However, they ca n't create documents in XX/XX/XXXX, as promised two weeks ago? The bank is hiding the fraud on this account by deleting the furnished data. That is fraud. The envelope received today did not come from XXXX either, despite the return address. It has been an annoying habit that letters are mailed from Bank of America from states other than the one it is written from. I suspect this is the bank 's way of avoiding the Attorney General of the state listed from having jurisdiction on the matter. This is compounding an already disasterous situation for no reason. The letter in no way allows a customer to talk directly to the place listed on the letter. Clearly, it was a fake form letter.",

    "complaint_what_happened": "After several unexpected medical bills, and with no living family to turn to, I was forced to search for a quick way to pay bills in advance of my regular paycheck. I found Green Trust Cash after a frenzied google search and the agent I spoke to was friendly and understanding, if hurried and pressuring me to see the benefits of having cash now. Agreeing, I accepted the terms of the loan, not understanding the incredible interest rates or the way that I would not be able to increase my payment schedule/pay the principal down quickly -- - although the agent I spoke to assured me that repayment was easy. I received the {$300.00}, less {$25.00} in wire transfer fees, and the schedule for repayment began. As per the loan agreement, I paid {$720.00} over the course of 3.5 months, more than 200 % of the loan. However, with the clear of day, I have come to understand that they are attempting to charge me 751.07 % ( or a total of {$1400.00} ) for a loan of {$300.00}. I was unable to keep up with their punishing 'repayment ' schedule, that actually kept the principle very high, so as to keep me paying for as long as possible ( more than 1 year ). I closed the bank account they were aware of in order to get some breathing room ( after being charged late fees/overdraft fees ). Then, before I was able to contact the lender about finding a schedule that would fit within my state 's legal repayment/interest laws, Green Trust Cash began to badger and call incessantly. Some times as often as 4 times a day, on my personal and work phone numbers. Having a diagnosed XXXX, I have been thus far unable to answer their abusive emails, voice mail messages or calls. I am in over my head and in need of help. Please do not trust this company. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I entered a Lease agreement with Chrysler Capital on a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I leased this vehicle from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. After I signed the lease I was asked to come back three more times to sign XXXX more leases. Each time I was told that there was an error and it was not the proper lease agreement. The payment and term stayed the same but some numbers changed. I was told to make my first payment to XXXX XXXX and this payment was included in the money that I put down on the XXXX. In late XXXX I was asked to make the second payment XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX because my paperwork had still not been sorted out. I made the payment and they cashed the check. I then got a call from Chrysler Capital telling me that I was two months behind on my payment. I was very frustrated at that time. I told the representative from Chrysler that I was considering having an attorney look at paperwork because so many mistakes had been made. He asked me if I had an attorney, I said I had a divorce attorney. My divorce had been final only weeks before this. He asked his name of my divorce attorney and I told him. Unknown to me this put me on a list where I was n't to be contacted in ANY way for ANY reason. I had no idea. I was set on autopay and the last payment was taken out XXXX XXXX. The payment comes out of an investment account I do not keep a close eye on. In XXXX my car was repoed. I had no notice. Not a call, letter email-nothing. I was stunned but looked back at the account and realized payments were not being taken out. Chrysler said that they were not allowed to contact me because I threatened them with an attorney. I did not. I simply said I may have an attorney look over paperwork. I said this because I was concerned about fraud. I signed XXXX lease agreements and made XXXX payments that were never applied to my account even though the checks I wrote had been cashed. Also, Chrysler said that phone call in XXXX of XXXX was the last communication that was allowed and they absolutely were not allowed to make ANY further contact which is why I received No late notice or phone call. They say it would have been against company policy to contact me in any way. However, on XXXX XXXX I was sent a letter from Chrysler in regards to my insurance. I switched companies and they were worried it was canceled. I also received a call from Chrysler and I assured them I had only switched insurance companies and gave them all updated information and made sure my insurance company had Chrysler to be paid off in the event of an accident. Chrysler notified me when they were concerned with their own financial investment in the XXXX. They did not contact me when my own financial interest in the XXXX would be effected. They did not mind breaking what they say is \" company policy '' when they had something to loose but gave no thought to my interest. This has ruined my credit and caused financial and emotional hardship. I have supporting documents but scanner is broken. I have at least XXXX lease agreements and I believe I have all XXXX. I have late payment statement from Chrysler. I have canceled checks proving I made the first XXXX payments and they cleared. I have letter from Chrysler Capital proving they contacted me regarding insurance. I have other supporting document \n",

Drivetime.., is the company I have my car loan with. From XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX.., I attempted to make actions to pay off my loan early and thus, by recommendation of Drivetime, started making payments 1 1/2 times to 2 times required payments. However each month seemed I owed monies when I prepaid. I attempted to resolve this .., but received little to now cooperation. XX/XX/XXXX payment was collected of which Drive Time did not give me credit for and showed my car as being repossessed. At this point I requested an Audit of my account and after 3 months, my funds were finally applied. However my payments status and balance were still in question. I have tried 15 different times and at least 20 hours of phone time to try and get the payment schedule along with how my payments should have been allocated corrrected to no avail. Seems DriveTime made attempts to get it right and then will report incorrectly again and again. I have been working to get my credit straight for almost 2 years to purchase the home I currently live in. These errors with Drive Time have not only cased a monetary hardship for me but is directly affecting my ability to be mortgage ready. ( needless to say I am still renting a house I should have been able to buy several months back if this issue with DriveTime did exist. ) I am truly at a loss and really do n't know where to turn. I do have a payment schedule I requested from Drivetime, which does reflect my prepaying several months in advance. However, per my last conversation ( which I have ever conversation documented date and times ) I was told by a Drive Time customer service rep., there had been errors made to ALL customers in terms of reporting for XX/XX/XXXX and the entire year had to be resubmitted. I did ask to speak with her manager and she informed me there were no managers at her level I have XXXX basic items first, why has DT reflected 30/60 days late when in fact I prepaid months in advance.. and per serveral conversations with DT wanted these errors corrected. And I believe based on the misappropriation of my funds paid my balance is higher than it should be. I would like to have these things fixed and some kind of monetary compensation for the out of pocket expenses and hardships experienced due to these issues. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "Netspend has caused me several issues. First I filed a transaction dispute. I informed them I had the card in my possession, and they failed to inform me that the card was being locked ( and also did not do anything to assist in the provision of a new card ). After the card not working on a purchase the same evening I called them the next day. After reviewing my account, and myself telling them about the dispute, they told me to use the old card at an ATM. Only after that failed as well did they tell me that the card had been disabled. They were only willing to waive a XXXX fee to send a card in 7-10 business days even though they mislead me, and failed to offer a new card ( I asked that it be expedited ; 3-5 business days ; with any fees waived. They refused, and said to get it expedited I had to pay XXXX ). \nAfter receiving the new card everything was fine until the date of this complaint. I was enrolled in their XXXX to keep from having fees every time I used the card. I found XXXX total fees, and that the plan was no longer set on my account. I called to have the reset the plan, and told them that I needed those fees reversed due to the fact that I never cancelled the plan. They returned XXXX of the fees. After calling them again they refused to return any further fees quoting that the plan \" had expired ''. There was no indicator anywhere of any expiration. \nAnytime I have asked for a supervisor they would attempt to refuse me. I have to literally yell at them to stop talking and get a supervisor at which point I am put on hold for an average of 15-20 minutes. Any supervisor I have spoken to has refused any request I made quoting \" we do n't have access in the system to do that ''. Once I asked for someone above the Customer Service Supervisor. I was flat out denied access to anyone further. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "Dear XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX I am contacting you at the suggestion of MN Attorney General XXXX XXXX. I contacted the MN Attorney General 's office XXXX XXXX, XXXX because of grave concerns regarding Reverse Mortgage Solutions ( RMS ), ( subsidiary XXXX XXXX ) business practices and how they use stalling tactics coupled with poorly trained customer service reps who loose paperwork, are rude, tell me I have done something wrong, etc., to keep me from purchasing my family property at 95 % of current market value. \nIn XXXX, XXXX my mother was coerced into signing a reverse mortgage on a house that had been paid for many years. Mom was thinking this was some how the end to her financial worries, as promised, because like her and so many elderly victims of this kind of abuse, she had more dollar value in property than she had in liquid cash. This mortgage company and others like it prey on the weak and elderly. These companies operate with little to no over-site by state and federal government and steal equity and property from occupants and heirs. If RMS was playing by the rules set forth by HUD XXXX, I would not be writing to your agency. \nThe FHA case number to the loan is : XXXX. It is my understanding that as her heir, daughter, I am entitled to purchase the property for 95 % of market value as stated in her closing papers from \" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' and the paper work that was delivered to my dead mother 's mailbox dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX from RMS. I am a cash buyer so I did not require loan approval or funds. \nI have clearly stated to RMS I am interested in purchasing the property several times over. \nMy mother passed away XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, was buried XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and Reverse Mortgage Solutions ( RMS ) was notified of her death XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by my sister. She called the RMS the customer service number noted on Mom 's monthly statement. \nA condolence letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was delivered to my dead mother 's mailbox via US mail even though RMS knew she was dead and I was listed as the contact person for my mother 's RMS account. Every year, mom had to sign a paper stating she was still living in her house ( occupancy ) and clearly state who to contact if RMS needed to do so. That was my first red flag with this company - many, many more were to come as I continued to deal with RMS. \nI called RMS general customer service number only after leaving several messages with XXXX XXXX, my POC who was suppose to guide me through the process. I only talked to XXXX 's voice mail, never to her in person. Her VM stated she would return calls within 48 hrs. Well, that NEVER happened!! I have yet to talk to XXXX. Plus, the extension to the telephone number listed on the paperwork never did work!! Any time I attempted to call XXXX, I would go through the customer service number - the same XXXX my sister used. \nI was told by RMS customer service to state my intentions of what I want to do with the house. I clearly marked the box that stated the 95 % pay off option ( which was explained to me by RMS that meant current market value ) and Faxed the letter back. I kept the cover sheet from the Fax transaction clearly stating the Fax was indeed sent and received correctly. Additionally, I hired a probate attorney on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to represent the estate through the probate process. \nRMS has illegally accelerated foreclosure proceedings on the property. According to HUD guidelines, I had 9 months before that was to begin. RMS has made a complete mess out of this seemingly easy transaction and with no legal oversight by state and federal regulators, RMS continues to conduct business in an injurious manner. \n( in order to continue this form I checked Making Payments, does not fully apply ) \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "Hello Viewers, I 'd like to start by saying, i brought a toyota pruis 2010 at XXXX, put down XXXX dollars, and they made my payments XXXX a month or XXXX biweekly which is fairly affordable. But once i realized the many issues of this company etheir not receiving my payments for months at a time or late each time without notifying me, I became skeptical and highly frustrated. I always called them or answered my phone for them to sort things out and stay in good standard. But now almost 2 years later only being late 3 times, i still owe XXXX, XXXX. How in the world is this possible when I am told often to recheck my balance on line to see accuracy ... or wait for the statement..all in which XXXX say I owe XXXX XXXX still. I feel ripped off and stuck in a worst runt than before getting this car. I feel I am stuck owing this company for many more years and nothing is being done about them ripping people off. I pray to get out of this Unreasonable and unfair loan right away. So DO NOT TRUST the representatives that call you for Consumer Profolio Services because they do not hold to their word. They make verbal agreements or promises but when you check your remaining balance on your loan, it shows way more than you actually owe each time. They also do not communicate well with XXXX another about your personally information or changes in your loan. They will take your funds before and after they are due without permission. Causes your account to overdraft or double pay. They will continuously charge you even if they have said they waived late fees, and claim they put your payment 's in the back of your loan even when you caught up with your car payments. They will call and harass you all through out the day even when you make a payment agreement and stick to them. They find ways of receiving your payment 's late or say they are unable to take your funds due to the bank not releasing it, which I found each time to be a lie. These faulty errors make your loan extremely hard to decrease or payoff let alone go away at all. It is not worth anyones hassel to deal with this unprofessional and very rude company. Take your services safely elsewhere. Itll save you the stress in your life and not having to owe a loan 50 % more than what you actually owe. I truly hope this was helpful to someone reading about Consumer Porfolio Services.",

    "complaint_what_happened": "XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Below is my complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and is an example of why the American people are angry with the government and its agencies for not holding the Big Banks accountable ( one of the biggest is Wells Fargo ) in helping the American Homeowners get affordable mortgage modifications and stay in their homes. \nI am a XXXX, single, XXXX woman who works XXXX jobs and have been trying to get an affordable Mortgage modification from Wells Fargo while in Bankruptcy. \nI am a victim of Predatory lending. I was given a pick-a-payment loan in XXXX by XXXX XXXX who is now Wells Fargo. Before Wells Fargo took over from Wachovia who had my mortgage at that time, they told me that in order to qualify for the Help for Homeowners mortgage modification program I had to be in default of my loan. They advised me to stop making my payments and then I would qualify. So, I stopped making my payments to qualify. They also said because of my age and the fact that I was an unmarried single woman that women are considered a high risk. \nI filed for Bankruptcy in XXXX of XXXX. I filed a modification and had XXXX meditations with my attorney, Wells Fargo 's Attorney and an attorney who was a mediator for both parties. \nIn the first mediation, for a new modification for a fixed mortgage of {$320.00} at 2 % and they said the new payment would be {$1000.00}. My attorney said I was paying that to the trustee and there would be no problem. My attorney questioned their Good Faith estimate which they used to try to show how I did not qualify. He asked what the {$7000.00} fee for forced place home owner 's insurance and also the incorrect amount of my salary by not including my bonuses from both companies I work for. Their attorney agreed that if this was reduced and the bonuses where included this would help in me being approved. \nThe mediator said that she would waive her fee for the next meeting to get this resolved for all parties. Wells Fargo attorney told everyone that once I submitted proof of new Home owner 's insurance and a Letter of Explanation of my bonuses, that my figures were good and I would have no problems qualifying and getting approved for the modification. We all agreed to meet again after they received the paperwork. \nThat same day, I sent my attorney a new Homeowners policy for XXXX and more pay-stubs the next day along with a Letter of Explanation regarding the bonuses I receive from both companies I work for. My attorney submitted the paperwork to Wells Fargo the next day. \nWells Fargo refused to meet with us again to review everything, and instead sent a denial letter for the modification. \nSo, I filed all over again several times and finally got approved ; I spoke with XXXX XXXX my Wells Fargo loan specialist who told me I was approved for {$290000.00} modification at 2 % fixed mortgage with a payment of {$1500.00}. I made my XXXX Trail payments I was required to make and after the third payment they sent the new modification paperwork. \nHowever, the new mortgage modification I received the note went from {$290000.00} to {$640000.00}. The house only appraised at XXXX. \nHow was I denied a {$320000.00} mortgage and now am approved for a {$640000.00} note? This is nothing more than predatory lending again! How can a XXXX, single, XXXX woman in bankruptcy, sign a Mortgage Note for more that the house is appraised for? What I want as an outcome is an affordable fixed mortgage based on what I was denied in the first mediation and even now at 2 % at the appraised value of the house which is {$290000.00}. \nThis is exactly why XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX won! Because the American people are tired of the corruption of the government not doing anything and banks get away with it.",

This evening, XXXX XXXX, I called to request for my XXXX late charge to be removed, explained my hardship again and explained I will not be late going forward and I was told that my payment was late due to my own error and not a bank related error they would not be able to assist me. I find this unbelievable that a company would treat their customer in this way. I could have just avoided them for a couple of weeks until the payment was withdrawn from my account, but I did n't. I gave them notice that I was having a small and temporary hardship and I feel like they took advantage of me. They basically assured me that my account would be okay and mislead me to get me off the phone and on to the next customer call. Due to this, knowing the risk involved I closed my account immediately further damaging my credit, all because this bank wanted to take advantage of my situation. The sad thing is I know I am probably not the only person who tried to do the right thing and be proactive, but for what? \n",

Federal Regulations and state laws allow me to have a Security Freeze placed on my credit file, if I provide the proper documents to the credit bureaus to place the freeze. I am sending the complaint because I sent proof of being a victim and all my documents to Experian to freeze my credit and they have failed to place a freeze. With failing to honor my request, they have left my credit open to new liabilities and fraudulent acccounts. The response I received last was that the information I provided was not complete enough in my complaint. However, I was very specific about dates I mailed documents and what was mailed. I should not have to contact Experian for a third time. My experience was that I called them and they tried to sell me a freeze or other monitoring services. I understand that this is very common practice after consulting with my insurance company and their famililarity with credit bureau practices. \n",

We have been receiving numerous telephone calls from National Enterprise Systems ( NES ), most recently XXXX yesterday where they actually left a vm message on our answering machine, informing us that they were debt collectors, yet the caller I.D . only showed the phone number ( ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and that the call came from XXXXXXXX. I called the number and got a recording that identified the company as ( NES ) Prior to that, they had been calling us from XXXX, XXXX and using a phone number of ( ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). I believe that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has sold my sons student loan debt to NES. My son is currently working with a company to help him manage his student loan debt and he informed me that they have reached out to his creditors to attempt to pay his debts. My wife and I are retired and we do not get involved in our sons financial affairs. My wife 's health as of late has not been good as she had a XXXX a few months ago. The added stress of companies such as NES constantly calling us and harassing us is adding to her stress level. I had previously filed a complaint with your agency back in XXXX of 2015 concerning a similar situation with Navient/XXXX ( Ref complaint # XXXX ) and I have received well over 100 phone calls from them since filing that complaint. If my son was a deadbeat and blatantly refused to own up to his financial obligations, I would not have a complaint but that is not the issue here. These companies that finance student loans and the third party companies that they sell these loans to for collections are predatory sharks and action needs to be taken by our government to stop these strong arm tactics used by some of these companies",

    "complaint_what_happened": "On XXXX/XXXX/16, I contacted Sallie Mae to attempt to place my loans into temporary forbearance and was met with extreme indifference to my financial hardship. I work as a XXXX and have been unable to find work for approximately two months ( in or outside of my field, despite actively searching throughout my entire period of unemployment ). This has unfortunately led to a state where I have had to live exclusively off the meager amount of money I had been able to save over the previous year. This bout of unemployment was extremely unexpected and a large percentage of my disposable income from the previous year had been channeled into paying down my student loans, far exceeding the minimum monthly payments. \nKnowing that I would be unable to make my XXXX payments I placed my federal loans into forbearance, without issue, and had hoped that Sallie Mae would be as willing and flexible with helping me avoid falling into delinquency on my account. \nUpon contacting the company and explaining my situation, I was given the option of forbearance on the stipulation that I would make a \" Good Faith '' payment, equal to XXXX % of my monthly minimum payments. I explained how I am not in a financial position to make any payment of any amount at this time and inquired about further options that the company may be able to offer. \nThe second option I was given, was to put in a retroactive forbearance by using my previous month 's payment as the \" Good Faith '' payment. Thus negating any progress I had made on my principle and interest for the previous month. While XXXX supervisors I spoke to made this suggestion, my first representative ( who also checked to see if this could be an option ) explicitly told me that it would be illegal for the company to use a past payment in such a manner. Upon raising this concern XXXX supervisors gave unclear, vague and dismissive explanations as to why the first representative made such a statement. \nWith both options being unviable, the first of which I am financially unable to comply with and the second I felt extremely uncomfortable about due to conflicting information, I inquired further for any other options or exceptions that could be made for my particular circumstance. Specifically noting that : # 1 I have, multiple times in the past, paid in-excess of my minimum payments, ( which I was explicitly told could not count towards reducing future payments, despite their website clearly stating otherwise ( XXXX ) ) # 2 My account has never been delinquent and # 3 I have been in good standing since beginning to repayment of my loans. Despite pleading my case, I was told that there was absolutely nothing else the customer service department could do for me, and that the only other avenues for relief options would arise only if my account fell into delinquency and was sent to the collections department. Who, as I was told, have more flexible means of dealing with those who are unable to meet their financial obligations. Leading me to believe that both supervisors were essentially implying that becoming delinquent was the most viable course of action in my situation ( which I was trying to avoid by contacting Sallie Mae in the first place ). \nI am appalled that Sallie Mae treated me with such blatant rigidity regarding this \" Good Faith Payment '' policy, especially in light of my payment history with the company ( should that not prove my \" good faith '' to repay these loans? ). And feel like I am being extorted for what little money I have so that my credit ( which was severely burdened by taking these loans out in the first place and has taken extensive effort to repair ) is not damaged by delinquency/collections. \nI sincerely hope others may read this and take it as another reason, and another warning as to why they should not do business with Sallie Mae. \n",

This is a stupidly small amount and if either of us owed it, we 'd pay it outright ...

The letter was delivered uncertified. \n\nII. I responded on XX/XX/XXXX. In that letter, I asked Pressler and Pressler , LLP to validate the date. The letter stated to respond to a specific Notary Public ( who would verify and validate receipt of said validation ) within 30 days. The letter was sent by certified mail and received by Pressler and Pressler , LLP approximately one week later. \n\nXXXX. I also pulled down my credit report and saw that this debt had been charged off. \n\nXXXX. I was served with a lawsuit on XX/XX/XXXX by Pressler and Pressler , LLP regarding this matter. \n\nISSUE : This firm stated they were retained by XXXX XXXX. That claim is patently false, since the debt was charged off. If XXXX XXXX was still pursuing this debt, it would not be at that status, so this firm has made a false statement regarding its disposition on this matter. Further, this firm has stated they are a debt collector further down in the letter. This indicates that they obtained this debt as third party debt collector. \n\nThe statements made by Pressler and Pressler , LLP in the letter are fraudulent and misleading, and intended to intimidate. Further, Pressler and Pressler , LLP has extended this fraud into court. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "I purchased an appliance from Best Buy and used their offer of charging the purchase on my Citibank Best Buy credit card which offered no interest for 18 months. I waited for my bill to arrive and had budgeted the money to pay the bill. No bill arrived when expected, so I thought that it was simply delayed in the bureaucratic pipeline. I contacted them after realizing that it had been much longer than reasonable to receive the bill. They charged that I had requested a paperless billing and that the bills had been sent. I may have made the request, but I had received no bills, paperless or otherwise, and no phone calls either. I initiated the contact and discovered that my {$680.00} purchase was now a {$740.00} charge due to late fees. I XXXX, so I am confident that if any emails had been sent, even if they arrived in my spam folder, that I would have gotten them. I believe that it is possible that the creditor is making a practice of not supplying the proper statements to the consumer on time so that they can collect fees in lieu of the promised interest-free charge. I believe that there is an element of fraud in this practice. Any creditor would notify a consumer by phone if they were not receiving payment for a period of two months! I had no phone calls from Citi Best Buy MasterCard concerning any matter, least of all an account that is 2 months in arrears! I might have gone on accumulating late fees if my wife had not asked me about the account. I went online and registered the card account and found what they were charging me and of their claim about paperless statements being sent. The person with whom I communicated, XXXX XXXX, said that she could not ( or would not! ) deduct the late fees until I paid the bill : and she would only credit half the fees, not all of them. I paid the account in full that very day, including the disputed fees and requested the account be closed. My credit history is a tribute to my ability to pay ALL my bills on time. It seems to me that a creditor 's ability to collect late fees on an interest-free credit agreement is a great impetus to make sure the consumer does not receive the billings on time. How long would they have waited to contact be because the account had gone unpaid? As it is, I paid an extra {$62.00} for the interest-free purchase. Maybe that is a small price to pay to learn about the credit practices of this company. How many others have been, and will be, defrauded by this practice? \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "I wrote a letter in response and follow up to a phone call I had made to a representative of Pay Pal and was instructed to send Pay Pal a letter documenting a complaint that I felt borders predatory practices. \n\n\" On Monday the XXXX day of XXXX, I was asked by a property management company if I would sign up for a pay pal account to pay an invoice they had prepared for me. It did not appear to be that big of an inconvenience, and thought in doing so, I may use from time to time when vacationing via XXXX, to pay for stays seeing it is widely used throughout XXXX. After joining, I paid a small invoice and thought nothing more about until I received a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/2015, stating I had been denied credit. I know that I had not requested any credit cards with pay pal, or any other type of credit, I became alarmed that someone was using my information that I provided when joining pay pal and quickly called to cease any malicious action on my behalf that may be occurring. After speaking with the pay pal representative and her looking over the online correspondence, it appears, from her account that I entered the last XXXX of my social thinking that it was part of signing up for a pay pal and inadvertently requested credit on my behalf, which I most certainly was not aware of! She told me that this is a common mistake and to write this letter. With that said, I feel that the way in which the credit is presented appears to be consistent with the remainder of a pay pal account, and most definitely not a third party/bank ( XXXX XXXX Bank ) soliciting and extending credit. I believe it is predatory in nature and a reputable company such as pay pal should remove immediately and or make VERY clear what the nature of the pop up window is. \n\nI kindly request that pay pal remove any and all request for credit off my credit report. \n\nThank you in advance for your cooperation. \n\nSincerely, XXXXXX '' Last XXXX of SS : XXXXDOB X/XX/XXXX \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "I found out that on XXXX XXXX XXXX that my home was going up for auction on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I had tried working with nationstar ( the company holding the note ) to work on a modification. My ex-husband XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX put XXXX in place in XXXX and I paid on it through XXXX and XXXX until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I had made a verbal agreement that he would pay the XXXX payment of which he did not. By the time the bank informed me about no payments on the house I was XXXX payments late. I did not have almost XXXX to give them so I asked if I could do a modification since I was the XXXX that had been paying for the house for the last two years. I was told no XXXX XXXX would have to do a modification because my name was not on the Note of Mortgage. But I found out on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that my name was put on the mortgage note in XXXX in book XXXX page XXXX. My ex-husband did the modification by himself in XXXX of XXXX recorded in book XXXX page XXXX. I asked Nationstar at the time because we were seperated and I intended to purchase the house from my exhusband if I needed to fill out a modification myself. I was told no the house note was only in my exhusbands name. Upon being served by the lawyer holding the auction on my home I found out that in XXXX when we remodified my loan with XXXX my name was put on the note without my signature or consent, and also on the note with my consent. I did sign a note in XXXX due to the lawyer stating I was signing my name just to the title not knowing it was the note, but we refinanced in XXXX and NEVER signed the note, but the lawyer rolled the mortgage over with my name on it without having me sign the note. I removed my name from the deed on XXXX because the bank I was working with to purchase the home said I could not purchase something I technically already owned so I removed my name from the title for purchase. This is when I found out that there was over another XXXX dollars worth of liens on my home and the bank backed out and found out that my name was on the note for a second mortgage of which I had no clue exsisted. Both my exhusband and myself had put a second mortgage on the house in XXXX through XXXX credit, but that was paid off by myself in XXXX in full. I just want to purchase my house, cut through all the wrongs that have been committed to me and keep my house. I have every piece of paperwork, but cant not attach over XXXX pages to this. If you want every piece of my mortgage from the original purchase date of XXXX I can and am more than willing to do this. I currently have no clue who owns my home other than XXXX that purchased it back at auction for XXXX. I know that by putting my name on a document I did not sign is not legal, so I would like to know were I am to go and what I am to do to keep my home. I have now been given a bill saying that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) owns my home and that the breakdown of money goes at they purchased the house for {$150000.00} but principal, interest and XXXX charges and escrow was {$240000.00} and foreclosure fees and costs is {$7300.00}. I do not feel I should be responsible for this. \n",

This is debt forgiveness that has not yet been realized as the dates have not been hit and I still have to perform. This is tax fraud ( it has been reported to the IRS ) and I have no doubt that OCWEN is treating all other similar HAMP mods the same way as they are desperate to have losses to package as \" advance receivable trusts '' or similar debt instruments. \n\nOCWEN can not take the \" loss '' in XX/XX/XXXX ( in violation of the HAMP mod terms ) without immediately granting me the debt cancellation rather than making me wait several years. OCWEN ca n't pick up their end of the stick without picking up my end also. \n\nI am harmed by the illegal acceleration of the debt forgiveness as I am obligated to show an additional $ XXXX in \" income '' on my tax return. This is unconscionable. The schedule for debt forgiveness is on \" page XXXX of XXXX '' in the agreement, paragraph XXXX ( C ) \" the modification ''.

    "complaint_what_happened": "During my time in XXXX XXXX, the company I worked for forced its employees to take out loans for housing. Unfortunately, the workplace was abusive and I quit to move back to the States. The loan company there sent the loan to a collection agency in the states. After speaking with the collection agency here, I told them I was n't working. They continued to call me. Recently, they called my daughter. I have no idea how they got her numbers, but I called the collection agency and told them to stop calling me and my daughter. When I spoke to the collection agency, they said they had no record of me or my daughter. Recently, my daughter told me they called my mother. \nI told them more than once I was forced to take out the loan and they need to speak the with company that forced me to do so because I 'm not responsible for the loan, the company that forced me is responsible. They continue to harass me. When they call now the number comes up on my caller ID as unknown. They call sometime two or three times a week or more. They have called my daughter twice and my mother once. When they called my daughter and mother the number on the caller ID came up as unknown too. \nIf they do n't have a record of me, why are they continually calling and harassing me? \nTheir employees tried to bully me : one employee suggested I take out loans to pay this loan, borrow money from family, and go back to an old job from about ten years ago while asking me what I planned to do about this loan. I reiterated the loan was the problem of the company who forced me to take out the loan and that 's who they need to speak with.",

XXXX XXXX XXXX do not represent XXXX, do not have proper documentation to subpoena bank records and do not have a judgement pending against XXXX. \nWhat 's worse, XXXX XXXX XXXX mailed the subpoena to XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, according to metered stamp.

The house foreclosure papers were delivered to us on approximately, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. \nI have given Bank of America this information over and over again. Once I give them the information the calls stop for a day or two but then they start again. There are times they call 3 times a day. \nSometimes I answer the phone and immediately hang up. Sometimes I ignore it. I do not owe them any money and have exhausted everything I know to do to make them stop harassing me, short of rehiring my bankruptcy lawyer, which I can not afford at this point. \nI hope you can help. \nSincerely, XXXX XXXX \n",

Later I received my statement and noticed that Citi charged 27.99 % ( APR ) on this debt ( today the balance is only {$3000.00} - as of XX/XX/XXXX ). \n\nI called Citi today XX/XX/XXXX and Citi confirmed that the arrangement has ended and there is nothing they can do to reinstate the arrangement, and instead they will charge on this credit card 27.99 % APR. The employee that I spoke to was XXXX, Account Manager of Citi located in XXXX, Florida. As a courtesy she credited {$78.00} for one time ; however Citi will continue charging on this account 27.99 % APR. \n\nMy complaint is based that Citi can not consider an arrangement breached because of a delay in the payment for 10 days that was unintentional. \n\nSincerely, PC \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "The trouble with CitiMortagage began several years ago. I was XXXX. When the market fell apart, so did my income and I got behind on my payments. XX/XX/XXXX I started a new job at the company that used to sell me my materials. This job is indoors and offers consistent pay regardless of weather and the construction market. XX/XX/XXXX we started the process for a re-modification on our home. We were approved as of XX/XX/XXXX and set to make three ( 3 ) months of trial payments thru XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. After completing this process we found that we had been denied due to some missing paperwork. A sale date of XX/XX/XXXX was set at this point. I complained to them about the fact that we had responded to everything they had sent in a very timely manner and that we had never received the papers they were referring to. They then sent the paperwork out, we had them signed and notarized and sent back in the same day. Then they told us that the previous paperwork had expired and we would need to refile everything we had done. She sent me the list and I got everything they requested sent off that same day. This all took place in XX/XX/XXXX. It was not until XX/XX/XXXX that they came back with an official denial of the re-modification. The reason they gave was that since I had to file for a re-modification twice in the same year they believed my situation had not changed. I was fully capable of making the payments and had done everything asked of me. It feels as though I am being bullied out of my home of 13 years. \nAt the time of denial i was told that a short sale was approved. I contacted my realtor and we found a buyer and asked for a postponement in order to close. They have now denied the postponement claiming that I am not approved for a short sale. This was an FHA loan and I have been told that if a re-modification was denied that I am automatically approved for a short sale. \n",

Yet I have checked my account as late as XXXX in the morning & it will show a positive balance only to check again later in the morning & find that they have processed checks, added to my account for the previous day which makes it overdrawn. They then charge me overdraft fees for those checks and/or debits added the previous morning. This seems to be a way for the bank to continuously collect overdraft fees. If I knew there were outstanding debits that were going to hit my account on a certain day I could try to cover them. When I do n't know then I assume my account is in good standing until at least the next banking day. This definitely puts the consumer at a disadvantage. If XXXX is the cutoff for a business day then the bank should not be allowed to post debits to accounts the next day as they have done to me on numerous occasions.

    "complaint_what_happened": "To whom it may concern : I had a XXXX XXXX auto loan that was charged off in XXXX for a balance of approximately $ XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX to negotiate a settlement. A verbal agreement was reached, but no payment or document was signed. Personal circumstances would n't allow me to fulfill the agreement, I called and informed them. The rep. told me to call back if my situation improved. XX/XX/XXXX I received notification from my XXXX credit tracker accounts that stated a charged off account from XXXX XXXX was reported to my credit reports, the balance was for over $ XXXX. \n\nI called XXXX XXXX and received an automated response that no one could speak to me. \n\nI filed a complaint with CFPB, and informed them of my situation. \n\nI was contacted by XXXX XXXX, see reviewed my complaint and the supporting documents I submitted. She stated that XXXX XXXX 's records do n't show they 're reporting a charged off balance of $ XXXX, but for only $ XXXX. XXXX closed my complaint as it being resolved. Soon after I pulled my credit reports and they showed a balance of $ XXXX. I contacted XXXX, informed her of my finds, and provided a copy of my credit report. She told me she would review it. I updated my CFPB compliant that my case was not resolved and sent a copy of my credit report. \n\nA week after I provided XXXX with my new credit report, she contacted me and stated that the balance of $ XXXX is correct, because in XXXX XXXX, the credit reporting agencies made a change that requires creditors to include interest and fees of past charged off accounts. I asked XXXX to send me a letter that highlights what she stated to me. She agreed. I followed up with an email asking her to send me the letter. I 'm currently waiting on the letter. Also, I called CFPB and updated them on my case. I was asked to call the credit reporting agencies to see if what XXXX XXXX said was true. I was only able to speak to a rep. from XXXX, the rep said it was not true to his knowledge, they only report want the creditors ask to be reported. \n\nI 'm not sure how many others may be effected by this practice, if it is indeed improper reporting. \n\nNote : The case number for my previous CFPB compliant is : XXXX. The pass code to open the PDF file is XXXX. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "My loan was serviced by Residential Credit Solutions. I tried to work with them, including having the city foreclosure prevention office contact them while I was in the office. The city 's representative spoke to the same person I dealt with, and offered a {$10000.00} good faith payment with the request to help me modify my loan. The woman flat-out refused, and when I called her shortly afterward, she first denied having spoken to anyone, then said she had spoken to someone, but that no offer of money had been made ( I was sitting next to the man when he called her ; I did n't tell her that ). The loan was transferred so many times, the original loan documents were lost. The lender filed an Affidavit of Lost Documents with the court, which is how I found out. I went to my foreclosure hearing and brought up the lost documents to the judge, XXXX XXXX. His response : \" They 'll find them. '' He signed the foreclosure order promptly. I continued to try to work with them, even finding a company who tried to negotiate with them with me on the conference call. The Residential Credit Solutions representative was very friendly, very nice, and said he would work with us to have the foreclosure order cancelled. Not long after, I learned that my house was being sold in a week, and it was. \nI tried before, during, and after the foreclosure right up until the house was sold to get anyone to help. I came across this site today just making another query to be certain I had exhausted all my options. My issues are : 1 ) the company did not operate in good faith when they refused the offer of money to partially cure the outstanding payments ; 2 ) the company similarly did not show good faith when an offer to cancel the foreclosure order was made to me and I was lead to believe they were working with me, when all they were doing was stalling until the sale ; 3 ) the original loan documents were never produced, although someone signed an affidavit stating he/she \" personally '' was involved in the sale ( which was not possible since the loan had been sold and transferred long after the sale ). \nWhen I read about the order for penalties against Residential Credit Solutions, I was hopeful there would be some recourse for me. Losing a home is traumatic, but losing XXXX due to someone 's unscrupulous, unethical, and deceitful practice makes it that much worse. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "My spouse and I have been struggling with our mortgage and XXXX offered us a plan to get caught up. We agreed to make payments for 6 months to get caught up - 'good faith payments ' they were called and after the 6 months of payments ... we would be evaluated for a modification. Or so they said. 4 months in, we made all 4 payments on time and had two more to go, our mortgage was sold to Caliber Home Loans. We did receive a letter stating that the mortgage was sold. Since we were on a payment arrangement with XXXX, we called Caliber to make sure the payments were still going to be deducted automatically from our account and to make sure they had our account information. However, when we called my spouse spoke with someone named XXXX and XXXX stated our home was going into foreclosure in 7 days if we did not pay the {$7800.00} that we were behind with on our mortgage upfront. If we had the {$7800.00}, we would not have been on a repayment plan. My spouse tried explaining this and he was told that if we did not have it in writing from XXXX, that arrangement could not be proved as valid. So then I stepped in and called Caliber and spoke with someone and I was told the same thing, we needed the agreement in writing and to fax it over if we could in order for us to continue with the original XXXX repayment plan. I tried explaining that every month we would get a 'notice of right to cure default ' and the notice states that \" If you have made arrangements to cure the delinquency of your mortgage and the agreement is kept, you may disregard this notice. '' We called XXXX the first couple of times we received this letter and they assured us that the payment was made and all was fine. Caliber Homes ( new mortgage company ) stated that did not count. So we call XXXX to inquire about receiving a record of the agreement ... my bank account reflects 4 payments automatically deducted as agreed by the way, but XXXX tells us they no longer have any trace of our records because the mortgage has been sold. At this point, I am ready to call a lawyer but my spouse calls Caliber homes one last time and speaks with someone named XXXX, extension XXXX, and XXXX states that XXXX ( original rep from Caliber homes we spoke to first ) was wrong and literally states verbatim that XXXX does not know what she is doing and XXXX is wrong. We are still on the original agreement schedule with XXXX called a 'step to modification ' according to XXXX . We are supposed to adhere to the XXXX agreement and then discuss a modification according to XXXX. Okay, a big sigh of relief right before XXXX. However, later that same day - XXXX from Caliber Homes calls my spouse on his cell phone and states that XXXX is incorrect. My spouse disagrees and states he does not want to deal with XXXX anymore and would like to continue with XXXX because XXXX seems to know what she is talking about and apparently XXXX had our records from XXXX and was quoting verbatim our initial and original payment agreement that we had with XXXX. XXXX stated that 'nope ', XXXX was wrong and our foreclosure was imminent. What in tarnation is going on here. \n",

When I was finally offered a modification, it was for a HAMP Tier 2 mod. However, all of the paperwork I was sent shows all of the loan modification that I did NOT qualify for and their terms and conditions. It did not show the terms and conditions of my current loan modification. I was told that I needed to make 3 trial payments and that I would then receive the terms and conditions. However, the trial payments I have been making is the same amount I was paying prior to the loan modification. I called and questioned if this were truly a modification, then why would I be paying the same amount as before? They could not answer my questions and put me on hold several times and just told me I had to wait for my paperwork to arrive. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "There were a number of other violations that I could have chosen on the previous question : Communication tactics : Threatened to take legal action, Continued attempts to collect debt I do not owe : Debt is not mine, False statements or representation : Indicated committing crime by not paying debt AND Impersonated attorney, and Improper contact or sharing of information : Talked to a third party about my debt. However, the threat to sue on a debt that is too old to be sued on is the most significant to me, as the alleged debt is outside the statute of limitations and can no longer be collected upon. \n\nMy dad was called by someone who was serving him notice via phone of a \" debt-related civil action pending against [ me ]. '' He was told to take down a phone number and a file number and have me call the company. When I called, I spoke to XXXX XXXX who, after several minutes of prompting, identified company as XXXX XXXX. I was told the company was a law office looking to collect on US Bank credit card account closed in 2008, an account I knew nothing about. I raised concern over the fact that I had never heard of the account or received any type of phone call or literature regarding collection, and over the fact that the debt was disclosed to my father, rather than through direct contact at my number. XXXX first told me they had been calling my number repeatedly and I had been ignoring the calls ( I had never received a call ) and later changed to \" this is the first time we 've sought contact with you. '' I could not get her to tell me the dollar amount of the account more specifically than \" over one thousand dollars. '' I accused the business and account of being illegitimate, and XXXX raised her voice at me and rattled off my full social security number to me twice, despite my protest and pointing out that practice was illegal. She spent the remainder of her time on the phone with me asking why I had n't paid, \" what [ was ] wrong with [ me ], '' and telling me that I needed to pay or they would sue me. I was transferred to transferred to XXXX XXXX. XXXX gave me the total in question ( ~ {$1200.00} ). When I told her the account was not mine, she told me to visit my credit report and mark the account as being the product of identity theft. She told me an investigation into the validity of the account would take approximately 30 days and that she would start the process of having me served with a summons so I could later appear in court with the record of dispute. She asked for my current address to do this ; I gave it to her and got off the phone. \n\nI checked my credit report where I found no record of the US Bank account. I checked a report generated a year ago and saw the account. The account is not mine ; I have zero recollection of opening or paying on this account. I attempted to open a dispute, and was unable to because the account had come off my report the year prior. I called the company back. I initially spoke to a man who told me that this was obviously my account, accused me of deliberate lying, and demanded I pay the amount today because they planned to garnish my wages or put a lien on my car to satisfy judgment rendered against me. He was speaking to me in a very accusatory and threatening manner, so I demanded that I be able to speak to XXXX again. She told me my only option was to pay or I would be sued. I caved in and I agreed, setting up XXXX payments to begin on the XXXX for an account that is not even mine. I was then transferred to a member of the \" accounting department '' who asked to record me. I allowed him, and he asked that I state my name, address, and telephone number to verify my personal information. \n\nI later contacted my attorney who informed me I had been victim to illegal practices under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and encouraged me to begin the process of protecting my information. \n",

A quick phone call to my buidings management office revealed that our building was XXXX % owner occupied. Not only did TD Bank not reconsider this XXXX % margin, but they have refused to send me the reason for the declination in writing or where this unreasonable prerequisite is stated. TD Bank knew full well that I had waited until they had all of my documentation and they had assured me that all was fine, before I was to submit the application to my building 's coop board, along with the {$400.00} finance application fee they required.

I know I qualify for at least 1 % less than the rate i have now and also they wo n't quit taking escrow money from me on this loan even though i have paid off more than 20 % of value of the property - so i want to refinance ASAP. They gave me the rate and the terms I was asking for in conversation over the phone, but then sent me paperwork with a higher rate. It took them two weeks to correct this. The process is just dragging, they keep coming up with new papers that I 'm missing and that are delaying the refinance approval. I was told weeks ago that my application is with the underwriter and that 's the last i heard from them. Their lawyer and appraiser contacted me the XXXX week into the process but i had to stall everything due to the bank 's disinterest and unresponsiveness. My locked in rate is due to expire in two days and they have not responded to my last XXXX emails in the last 10 days. I want my lower rate now!! \n",

Then I find that they went ahead and completed the transaction even after all the rejections and telling me I was providing wrong info. I then sent a message to Compass Bank through their on-line banking system, which they deleted. Sent another message about it, and have continued to send messages daily to the bank for a week now. Each time I send a message, I get a response stating they will try and respond within one business day, it is now at XXXX messages and not a single response. Have a feeling they want me to call and deal with this over the phone as that provides them with deniability as there have been other issues in the past. i.e. I signed up at Compass Bank under an offer that was mailed to me which promised free checking for life. A couple years later they changed this and started charging me, when I challenged them on this, they asked for a copy of the letter, my reply was that they had attached it to the original paperwork opening the account. I then called another branch and asked if they maintain the original paperwork on accounts and was told yes. I then proceeded to the original bank branch and told them I had been told they maintain this paperwork, they replied 'yes, it 's a banking requirement ', but then I provided my ID and lo and behold, my paperwork had vanished ... ..and of course no offer was made to attempt to find it.

    "complaint_what_happened": "Upon checking my credit report, I discovered that there was a {$450.00} charge from Kings Credit Service ( California ) pertaining to a medical bill that was from XXXX of 2011. This was the first time that I had ever received knowledge of the bill, and was confused about it because I was on XXXX in XX/XX/2011 '. I called the Agency ( KCS ), the woman that helped me said that back in XXXX of 2011 there were several failed attempts to contact me. She explained that all bills sent to my address were being returned and all calls made to the residence went unanswered. I asked for a verification of the address due to a confusion of why the bills would have been returned. She admitted that originally they had the wrong address, and that upon finally getting the right address, the bills were still being returned. I asked the woman how long it had been until they had the right address, she would not answer. She continued to tell me that at the number that I called her on was the same number that they attempted to reach me on, I believe she said three times, and that I must not have an answering system. I assured her that there has always been an answering system on our telephone, and that it does not ring so many times as to assume that there was not XXXX. She said that she did n't know, just that I signed an agreement that I would pay regardless of whether there were problems with insurance or not. She then asked if I could pay some of the balance, seemingly disregarding everything that I had told her. I told her that I would not make a payment at all, as I felt that it is not my fault that they failed to contact me when I was more than available. Given that I had medical insurance at the time, I would have gladly taken care of any bills that I knew were outstanding. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "I applied for a refinance on our home at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, on XXXX2016. My bank agent and I filled out the paper work to refinance and remove money from our equity. He said, he did n't think there was a chance unless there were some changes in our income.We went over the changes that had occurred over the last few years but, there was n't enough income, coming in with a five year expiration date. I needed to take out funds to help our daughter and her family with a stupid mistake they made, forgetting to worry more about their credit cards, then helping their children grow up with everything their hearts desire, including themselves.They were taught better but \" life '' takes over. They are paying 25 % and better on their cards as they never thought this could happen when they were taught the right way to handle finances.We would set up a loan with them including interest but still they would be able to make the payments.Our bank agent sent in our app anyway to see if there was something they could do to help this go through ... .They decided, even though I have a recorder over 20 years of credit card action without a late fee, the processor decided to close my accounts by calling each bank and paying off the cards. My bank agent sat with me doing this and removing monies needed to get a XXXX balance. It took hours. Normally, we pay directly from our checking account and I do n't have to carry cash around since I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and feel unsafe. This in itself was a terrible hardship. After always using my cards, I was not able to. While they were trying to work with their boss the processor requested {$550.00}. from my checking account which he withdrew with my approval as I understood he was trying to help facilitate the timing if we could get the appraisal taken care of. The processor kept trying to talk to his boss but I got no return calls, no e-mails while they were trying to make the loan work ... No escrow was even opened. The appraisal was done and I got the report which valued our home above the value I set on the application. The appraiser said we should have no problem with the equity we have already in our mortgage.I wo n't go into the waiting, anxiety and stress for what we were trying to do was costing our children thousands of dollars in interest only. \nI wrote them a letter asking for the $ XXXX..Since this was taken from me there was no escrow open or pre-approval of any loan. They answered my letter by sending me a form they filled out and dated back in XXXX for me to sign and return immediately The form was \" Intent to Proceed/Application fee notice. Since it was already XXXX they decided to transfer my complaint to their Customer Advocate and after going over all again with XXXX customer advocates they decided they needed to take their report to their superiors and it all came back No Return ... .I finally took the amount out of our retirement savings, which were stocks that we did list as assets, in order to stop the high interest our children were paying each month making no heading way with their debt and us making no headway with the bank.",

    "complaint_what_happened": "I opted to have my tax return of $ XXXX direct deposited into my PayPal prepaid card. When I logged into my account I pulled up the direct deposit tab and gave my tax prep the routing number XXXX and account number ***** -- -- XXXX. My return was accepted and sent out. My earliest date to receive my funds was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and the latest was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. After contacting my tax preparer to confirm the right account information was put in that 's when I noticed after now looking on their phone app that the routing number I provided was different from what was displayed. I log back in error the website to make sure nothing changed and the information I gave to be submitted was the same. So I had XXXX routing numbers or that 's what I thought. At this time the offices were closes so I sent an email through the site 's secured inbox and waited. The next morning I just decide to call to go ahead and be sure everything was ok. I was told by the first Rep everything was fine and that my money should come in no problem. This is now the XXXX late evening still no deposit. So I login on the website again and notice my email has I reply that I sent out the day before. This rep informed me that the routing I gave was not associated with my account but the other routing number that had displayed in the app, XXXX, was correct and to call the XXXX to change my information. Now confused I call the XXXX and they inform me due to security issues they are n't allowed to change direct deposit information and that my refund was already sent to the information I provided yet my account never showed this deposit. I call the card company back and they are now very dismissive and telling me bogus stories. First the routing number was correct and associated with my account along with the new XXXX I just found out about, then the routing number was n't associated with my account and the bank would reject it and send it back but mind you the XXXX had nothing rejected on their end, and then I was told the routing number was old and was changed back in XXXX yet it was still available as my direct deposit information on their up to date website. Im furious now as I am clearly being lied to for this Rep with all these different bogus stories. I request to speak to a supervisor who o ly tells me the same thing then suggested I call the IRS again to get a trace number to track the deposit. I do so the next morning as soon as they open. The XXXX informs me no rejections on my funds were made and they do not give out tracking info on direct deposits at all. Now how could my cars company not no that. I was told to contact XXXX and FDIC for information about what I should do. I wasbtold to gibe the information to my cars company that I was told by the XXXX and demand the right to my money because this was their error giving me the wrong deposit information. I even called the bank associated with the card and gave XXXX the routing number I had. The XXXX associated with my account came up as netspend the other no information. So I was told to contact the card company to ensure that those numbers would be the numbers needed along with the correct number for my money to appear in my account. I call them back and told them everything I 've done who I spoke to and what was said and how everyone agrees the company is at fault for losing my money. Im placed on old while the rwp goes over my account just for her to come back and say once again that if the information was incorrect the XXXX would reject it but they DID N'T. She tells me now I have to wait 6 days for the XXXX to receive a rejection hat they are not going to receive because my moneywas was placed somewhere successfully but not in my account! I informed them that I would indeed file a complain. I can not and will not wait six days for nothing when everyone else 's job was done right but theirs! I want my money deposited immediately. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "I have a construction loan through XXXX. The XX/XX/XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I began the process of converting it into a 30 year mortgage with 5/3 Bank. I was given a rate of 3.875 and closing costs of {$2000.00}. I was told on XX/XX/XXXX that because we had financed the home ourselves and not purchased it from someone or from a contractor that the loan would not be considered a \" new purchase '' but would be considered a \" refinance ''. I got very concerned and sent an email out to the lady that had been handling the loan thus far, XXXX XXXX of 5/3 Bank and asked her to let me know if this would affect my rate at all. XXXX XXXX is Vice President of 5/3 XXXX branch. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating my rate would in fact remain at 3.875. I told her to go ahead with the loan process and the appraisal. I began receiving calls from a mortgage processor, XXXX XXXX, from 5/3 Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a Mortgage Pricing Agreement from her via email that same day stating the terms of the loan with a rate of 3.875 and was told that as of that day our loan had a \" locked in rate '' of 3.875 and the closing costs were {$2000.00}. \nI told XXXX I was getting very concerned about how long this process was taking because we had gotten the certificate of occupancy XX/XX/XXXX and had been moved in since then. We wanted to close ASAP on the loan. She said it should n't be too much longer that it was all in process and they were waiting on the appraisal. \nThe appraisal was done XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX told me it would be back on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. It finally came back and I received an email from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX telling me what it appraised at. The home appraised at {$280000.00}. We were told we could borrow 80 % of the appraised value which would put us at {$220000.00}. We were only asking for {$200000.00}. I called XXXX and told her that to finish the yard was going to cost {$6000.00} and the closing costs were {$2000.00} and I would like to add both of those into the loan making the loan total {$200000.00} even. She said it would be no problem because we had not yet reached 80 % of the appraised value. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email titled Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement in which the details of the loan were spelled out. Again, it listed my interest rate at 3.875 but it still had the borrowed amount listed as {$200000.00}. I emailed XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and told her to call me ASAP because I did n't want wrong numbers being plugged in to my loan paperwork to cause even further hold up in our closing process. She replied that she was out and asked if it was ok to call me on Saturday morning. XXXX called on XX/XX/XXXX to discuss the loan. She said she wanted to go over my \" payment amount ''. When she quoted me what my payment was going to be I knew something was n't right. I questioned what she had my rate as. She told me that my rate had changed to 4.25 % Never once did she volunteer the information until I asked. When I asked why she said it changed when the loan was changed from a purchase to a refinance. I told her I had it in writing that it was 3.875 % as a refinance. She then said well then it is because we had a cash out amount. I told her our original loan amount was {$230000.00} and we had only hit {$200000.00} so that was not the case either. She then told me it was because the appraisal came back lower. I told her we had not even hit 80 % of our appraised value then she tells me that on certain types of refinances they can only loan 75 % of the appraised value. 75 % puts us at wanting to borrow {$210000.00} which we were n't. I told her to just forget it, that we would take the loss of the {$6000.00} and pay it out of our personal acct and we would pay the closing costs too so to go back to the original loan amt of {$200000.00} so that the terms would go back to 3.875. She said they could n't do that, that the terms had changed. What terms? We had a LOCKED IN RATE of 3.875. \n",

Further more in XXXX 2015 my account went further past due on my credit report even though I was making payments since XX/XX/2015. I sent the company 2 extra payments of XXXX from a shared account I have with my wife to make up for payments. I asked them just to debit those XXXX amount on this account but they continued to debit this account which I did not authorize which caused the account to incur NSF fee. This company has taken advantage of me trying to repair my credit has lied about not incurring fees has lied about my account not being reported deeper into past due status on my credit report and has taken money from my account with out my authorization.I have done everything they had asked me but had lied about the outcome. \n",

Green Tree claimed I owed for insurance they had placed on the home previously. I kept homeowners insurance on the property the entire time, for the value of the home as per the contract. Green Tree said I had to have insurance to cover the loan amount, but the contract did not say that. I refused to pay, and later that year they repossessed the home. I contacted Green Tree and requested to know how much they sold the home for, and they refused to provide any information. This was the last contact I had with Green Tree. In XXXX, I found out Green Tree had contacted my father. In XXXX I was XXXX XXXX XXXX with limited credit, so my father co-signed for the note. My father had his own loan with Green Tree, and I found out they contacted my father demanding payment of {$1500.00}. or they would call his current note due. My father paid {$1500.00}. to settle the claim without my knowledge. \nOn XXXX XXXX, XXXX I received a XXXX from Green Tree, now doing business as DITECH Financial, claiming they discharged {$5700.00} of debt I owed. I contacted them at the number listed on the form. \nThe automated system requested my account number, so I provided the one on the XXXX. It said the number does not match any acct. \nIt then asked for my SS #, which I provided. It said No Acct exist for this number. Finally I spoke with a representative. She could not provide any information other than to say I must have owed money sometime a long time ago on a mobile home. I claimed I owed nothing a and requested that she verify the debt, and she said those records do n't exist any more. I told her that was n't acceptable, that I did not owe anything to Green Tree, and unless she can provide me proof I wanted this XXXX corrected. She told me I must have owed money from a long time ago, and they decided to write it off on XXXX, so she refused to do anything. Once again I requested some proof I owed Green Tree anything, to which I was told the account and those records do n't exist anymore. \nHow can a company, without proof or documentation randomly place an XXXX burden on me with a XXXX for any amount they make up? I 'm guessing Green Tree does this, and then claims the deduction on their Federal Taxes, so would n't this be Tax Fraud? Even though they have n't tried collecting this amount from me, by filing the XXXX they have placed the debt on me unfairly, causing me to now owe the XXXX portion of this undocumented debt. \nI think Green Tree is guilty of criminal activity, and ask that a formal investigation be undertaken. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "XX/XX/2016 my husband was involved in a red-light accident, through no fault of his own, in which the vehicle was totaled. This vehicle was leased with Capital One Auto Loan division. The insurance company paid fair market value to Capital One, leaving us with a {$2500.00} balance. We did not receive any information from Capital One and found that our online account had been closed. We contacted the bank and found that we have about 120 days to pay the remaining balance. I explained to the agent that this was not possible as this would raise our monthly payment to over $ XXXX/month, double the amount than our normal monthly payment, and that this would be a financial hardship for us. I asked for an extension, and was told that none is available and that once the time-frame runs out, the account would be reported to the credit bureau as a charge off. \n\nThis is completely unfair. My husband was at a red light, and a teenager texting and driving slammed into our vehicle. My husband has sustained serious injuries and is frequently out of work due to the injuries. We have a young child in day care, and have our normal monthly bills to still take care of. I asked for a XXXX to call me back to see what could be done, and I have not been called back as of yet.",

In response I received a letter XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX, Customer Service Specialist at Chase who denied that we had met the requirement.

The rep agreed we were entitled to the bonus miles and said that she was going to use a different \" channel '' at Chase to get the points credited.

This one said \" As previously advised we only consider MATCHING BETTER OFFERS ( emphasis added ) within 90 days from the open date.

What 's the point of a Service Specialist putting a phone number with the hours he takes calls at the bottom of his letter if he does n't return calls? \nAll I want however, is for Chase to honor the offer that they made. \nA check box below asks how much money we lost. We have lost nothing out of pocket, but XXXX miles will fly me or my wife to California and back -- which is worth about $ XXXX. One of the reasons we signed up for the card was the offer, so in that sense they are defrauding us of as much as {$500.00}. \nXXXX XXXX",

    "complaint_what_happened": "Ok, so I have been receiving phone calls from XXXX phone number for the last few days. On the morning of Thursday XXXX/XXXX/2016 I received yet another one. So being fed up with it, I answered and said hello. All they would say and repeat was that they needed to confirm they were speaking with a XXXX XXXX ( which is me ) before they could disclose any further information. I stated that in that case I would not be providing them any further information on my part and hung up. My thinking was \" wait a second ''. You want to call my phone and start demanding I provide or confirm for you personal information about myself while refusing to provide me with information. Not ok!. So being that I am a Police Sgt, I went into investigative mode and started digging to see if I could find out anything based on the phone number I had from them. I discovered that it was a collection business called IC Systems. I further found hundreds of complaints from other people following their dealing with this company. So I returned a phone call to them and asked to speak with a supervisor. Once he was on the phone he also repeated the same line about needing to confirm who I was before he could provide any further information. I explained to him again that I would not be providing any personal information and since he or his company were the ones who had contacted me, they needed to be the ones that were forth coming with information, since I had no way to \" prove '' who he was. I also explained that I viewed their telephone communication with me to be harassment and that I demanded my number be removed from their calling list. He said that he could do that and would. If I owe a debt that I am unaware of fine, but how about calling and saying, Yes this is so and so and we have been retained by so and so to attempt to collect a debt that they claim you owe them. At this point I would have the ability to research for myself if I had forgotten something and get back with them. But no, they chose to try and act all secretive and shadowy which if they are legit in their pursuit, it is a very poor way of handling business. I ask that you as a consumer protection agency, please assist me with dealing with this matter. Thank you in Advance \n",

As is evident on the move out form the initial date had been crossed out and altered which is fraudulent information submitted and not vetted by the collection agency, I feel that the apartment personnel knew of her move out date and could have entered the apartment at that time and were overzealous in their charges. \nI understand that it was my responsibility to have given written notice to vacate, but due to extenuating circumstances with my health which culminated in XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, it was not high on my list of priorities at that time. I am a XXXX with limited income and was seeking some relief and resolution of this charge by writing the parent company of these apartments, to no avail since they have not responded to either of my letters. \nI have enclosed a copy of the bill with the disputed charges highlighted. \nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "My XXXX XXXX Costco card account was transitioned to Citi. Unfortunately I was locked out of my online banking and unable to resolve the issue on my own and forced to call into customer service. My wait time was well over an hour, and the issue is still not resolved. Many times I have been told that the account lockout was removed but turns out that they were incorrect and I 've had to call back multiple times, again having to wait on hold for inordinate amounts of time ( minimum 20+ mins ). It 's also very frustrating having to wait for an automated system to regurgitate my account information before even allowing me to choose why am I contacting them in the first place. \n\nExtremely disappointed that Costco went from a quality customer service provider like XXXX XXXX to this. \n\nLiterally just had a customer service rep tell me that there was no lockout or blocked access to my account, while their website says blocked access with reference to Error Code XXXX. \n\nLosing hours of my time for a remarkably simple issue as resetting a password is giving me a horrible first impression of this company.",

    "complaint_what_happened": "earlier on in the year of XXXX, I filed a complaint with you regarding the servicing of my loan from SpServicing. Reference case # XXXX. They were clearly not honest with there response to you regarding my XXXX payment and the final loan modification. I will attach all of my documentation including bank statements for the entire year of XXXX and the trial modification and the final modification. I also have a letter from them dated XXXX XXXX that my final modification was approved. The XXXX payment which they claimed, I did not make, was one of the 3 trial payments of which I phoned in XXXX, XXXX and XXXX payment on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. If I did not make my XXXX payment, how would I have been approved for the final modification as outlined in the trial modification? Once the final modification was approved, everything escalated from that point. Accusing me of not making payments and no one could tell me which payment was not made. I have had XXXX in XXXX and could not handle all of this along with my health problems so I retained an attorney after I received your response from SpServicing and their response as well. It also appears that they are not applying the payments correctly to the PITI as outlined in the trial modification and the final modification. I am reaching out for your help again to protect me as the consumer with the servicing of this loan do be done in accordance to the trial and final modification. They are also threating me with notices of default every month. How can they do this when all of my mortgage payments are made on time? You will be able to see this as I am attaching proof of payments for the entire year of XXXX. This mortgage company also will not let my attorney speak with their attorney and a manager does agree that I have a modification, but they have yet to honor it. My attorney is also getting frustrated with them and he now knows that all of my complaints about this company and the servicing of my loan are valid. He as well, has a copy of my final modification and proof of all of my payments. \n",

I spoke to XXXX and I explained how there was a delay with my bank sending the payment. XXXX, the supervisor, waived the late fee for XX/XX/XXXX. My XX/XX/XXXX statement, shows another late fee of {$35.00}. I asked XXXX why there was another late fee, and she said because I did not pay the {$75.00} for XX/XX/XXXX. I told her, I paid the {$35.00} and the other {$35.00} was from the XX/XX/XXXX late fee that was waived. So they billed me a late fee, on top of a late fee that was waived. The XX/XX/XXXX bill, was paid on XXXX/XXXX/15, in the amount of {$35.00}. I sent in a dispute, explaining the issue, and received a letter back, stating the charges were correct, which they are not. Now, I get my XX/XX/XXXX bill, and it has another late fee of {$35.00} on top of the erroneous late fee for XX/XX/XXXX After the XX/XX/XXXX payment, I paid the XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX, and the XX/XX/XXXX payment was paid on XX/XX/XXXX. Continental Finance keeps charging me a late fee from the late fee for XXXX, in which I clearly do not owe. Please review the attached correspondence and supporting documentation and it is evident that I do not owe these XXXX late fees of {$35.00} for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. \n",

XX/XX/XXXX I received in the mail a release of lien to file with the DMV, I also received a letter stating my Santander Consumer account was paid in full. As well my credit report currently shows the account as paid off, I sent the release of lien in to the DMV in XX/XX/XXXX when I received it. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 a repossession agent from XXXX XXXX XXXX showed up at XXXX XXXX to repo my car. I stated to the individual I had a copy of the release of lien on the vehicle and a letter stating from Santander Consumer my account was was paid in full. I showed all documentation to the gentleman, he then stated he 's never seen paperwork like that out on a repo before but he had a order of repossession and had to take it. He, then took pictures of documents I showed him and let me get my belongings out of the vehicle. He was very polite let me gather my belongings and then took the car. The following Monday morning I called the DMV an they stated their was currently no lien holder on the title. I then called Santander to find out details to why the repossession took place. The first person stated He was very sorry and my vehicle would be returned in the next couple hours in my driveway, it should of never been repoed in the first place account is paid in full. He put me on hold an a few minutes later said it was all taken care just needed approval from a upper level manager an it was all done. The manger would call the repossession company for return. I then waited an called again a few hours later. An I spoke with a lady, she stated I had some of my payments Return due to NSF charges on my account which is totally false I paid the balance in full. An have the confirmation numbers for all payments and postings to my account. She stated she wanted {$6000.00} to get my vehicle back and an could not issue me a copy of the full account payment history. An if I did n't pay my vehicle would be sold on XX/XX/2015.

These increases caused my payment to have shortages. \nXXXX Issue : When this happened in XXXX I sent in the shortage amount and it was received before XXXX, but the offices were closed for the XXXX holiday and not credited to my account. This triggered a computerized non-payment ( 30 days past due ) process, because it was not in the full amount. All XXXX of the major credit bureaus were given negative 30 days past due remarks. I eventually got a supervisor from Freedom Mortgage to fix the problem and sent me a letter that the credit bureaus were notified to remove the negative remarks. Fast forward to XXXX and the XXXX 30 days past due is still there. I only noticed because once again something similar occurred. \n\nXXXX : Similar situation, escrow increase, I adjusted my scheduled payment for the wrong month. I did n't realize anything was wrong until I got the financial hardship paperwork, I was confused since I made all my payments. I called them immediately and they said I was short on a payment ( {$120.00} ) and they did not credit any of my payment. I was told it would not be marked late if sent in the shortage right away. I did this and obviously that was not good enough and I was marked 30 days past due ( even though they assured me I would n't get marked late with credit bureaus ), then I got hit for 31-59 days past due because they were just holding 2 months worth of payments and not crediting my account. I spoke CS everyday Mon-Fri during the month of XXXX. I was sincerely trying to deal with this problem, I even sent in the shortage amount again during the month of XXXX, which seems to be an over payment. I waited the entire Month of XXXX to get in touch with a supervisor, calling every other day with no luck. They called my house phone once while I was work even though I specified them to call my mobile number. For the last 2 weeks in XXXX, I never got a call back from a supervisor to address these issues. I was told it would take 2-3 business days by a CS rep eventually, but that never happened. There 's no way to call back a supervisor and every CS rep has a different supervisor so you have to go through the front line ( and the long process ) every time you call in and hope that a supervisor is available ( never ), or will actually call you back ( not likely ).",

    "complaint_what_happened": "This is attorney XXXX XXXX writing on behalf of the borrower XXXX XXXX. My client sent a Rescission Letter under the Truth in Lending Act and Select Portfolio Service provided an inadequate Response to my client 's Rescission. The response is inadequate because it misinterprets and misrepresents the law surrounding rescission pursuant to Federal Truth and Lending Act-TILA 1635 ( b ), Regulation Z, and a Unanimous Decision by the US Supreme Court ( XXXX ). Under this law, as I stated in my letter, the creditor has Twenty days to \" return to the obligor any money or property given as earnest money, down payment, or otherwise, and shall take any action necessary or appropriate to reflect the termination of any security interest created under the transaction. '' Accordingly, SPS would have thus had Twenty days to either comply with the mandate of Federal Truth and Lending Act-TILA 1635 ( b ). \n\nAlternately, if Select Portfolio Servicing , Inc. wished to dispute the rescission, it could have filed a lawsuit along the lines of Quiet Title or Declaratory Relief in order challenge the rescission but this MUST HAVE BEEN DONE WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THE DISPATCH OF THE RESCISSION LETTER. In the XXXX decision, XXXX XXXX emphasized that \" Section 1635 ( a ) [ of Federal Truth and Lending Act-TILA ] nowhere suggests a distinction between disputed and undisputed rescissions ... .. '' By this logic, even though SPS might have wished to dispute the validity of my client 's rescission on the grounds that the underlying loan may not have been a purchase money loan or was allegedly consummated outside of the three year statute of limitations, the fact remains that when my client sent the rescission letter the rescission became valid by operation of law, and the onus would have been on SPS to file a complaint for Declaratory relief or Quiet Title within the 20 day time period proscribed by TILA. Select Portfolio Servicing , Inc., has now waived the right to contest the validity of the rescission on any grounds, because the twenty day time period has elapsed. Accordingly, the Secruity Interest in question is now void. \n\nThe fact that 3 years has elapsed is irrelevant because the statute of limitations ( or any other defense for that matter ) is a defense that the loan servicer or lender should have raised within twenty days of the receipt of the rescission letter. Moreover, it is not clear that Select Portfolio Service even has standing to challenge the rescission. \n\nThe response the SPS provided to my client 's Rescission under the Truth in Lending Act is boilerplate and completely does not address the underlying concerns addressed in my letter. Please have them address the concerns as outlined above. Moreover, until this matter is resolved I am asking that the impeding Foreclosure be cancelled. \n\nIf these concerns are not rectified in a manner that is satisfactory to my client by either complying with the Truth in Lending Act or providing an intelligent explanation as to why they are not barred by the 20 day rule, I will have no choice but to file a complaint in Federal Court for a Judicial Determination of this matter and Damages that my client may be entitled to. \n\n\nThank you, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. \nAttorney for Borrowers XXXX \n",

They have since called several more times to these same people. I have called more than once to get this resolved. I called the first time and it went to a machine and asked for my name and number and they would call back. The second time the phone just rung over and over with no pick up. The 3rd time it put me on hold and then to dead air. The last time the representative wanted to confirm my Social Security number where at that time I declined to give her that information and so she said she was n't going to do anything unless she knew I was the right person and hung up.",

PayPal did not notify me this was being done via email, phone or letter. I was not aware of this issue until XXXX/XXXX/15 when I logged into my PayPal account and saw the transaction and my account in the negative. There was a note from PayPal on my account demanded I fund the negative with my other bank account or credit card. I contacted PayPal and they claimed they tried to email me XXXX times before ruling in the buyer 's favor. I show no record of any contact attempt, although I had received other email from PayPal. They told me it was my fault for not logging into the PayPal system and checking on my account. I appealed the decision and they rejected my appeal.

My previous letters stated my reasons for an investigation and these reasons were not frivolous in any way. If this final request does not prompt you to conduct a proper investigation of the accounts in question, and send proof to me of said investigation, how it was done with who with contacts actions I will file a civil suit in XXXX County Against Transunion if no results for damages. I take my credit very seriously and your lack of proficiency and assistance is unacceptable. I am well aware of my rights under the FCRA and intend to pursue them to the maximum. It appears obvious to me that you are abusing your power under the FCRA to escape a complete investigation. I stand by the right to sue your credit bureau for violations of the FCRA and I believe I can prove to full extent, that you did not use reasonable measures to ensure the accuracy of my credit reports and now you are stalling the process further. I am irritated at your indictment and I have consulted with the court my rights in regards to my credit file. I look forward to your expediting my original request immediately.

Good thing I did not need the money, so I deposited it into the bank I use locally. I also have XXXX other banks I use. So how I look at this, XXXX I would never use PNC for any banking in the future or open an account with them and second how about people who do not have much money and that {$27.00} would mean food on the table or gas money to get to their job.

I discovered that when I wanted to deposit a check to my account, and the account disappeared. I called Chase, they told me because they charged {$15.00} per month when my biz account balance is below {$1500.00} for the past 8 months. The account went to negative and they closed it! \nOne would think at least a courtesy email should be sent to customer to inform them the situation. Not just simply close the account silently!!! That 's just WRONG! Not the mention they charge so much, {$15.00} per month, because the account did n't have the minimum balance! \n",

With several calls being made every month It took until XXXX XXXX to finally get the payments applied correctly. They got it rite for while then XX/XX/XXXX it started again payments being misapplied or held in a \" unapplied balance \" line till the next month. I called this weekend when I saw the mistake and left a message and they did n't get back to me until wed afternoon. Again they are being corrected but each time this happens I lose the time and interest from when it was received by them and then applied days or weeks later. I ca n't figure out how to calculate that and what I 'm losing but what I 'm really worried about is if they ca n't do normal banking without incident are they calculating my Mortage correctly? I make extra payments every month in an effort to pay it off quickly so I can retire but wondering if I 'm being cheated. Whether deliberately or by mistake I 'm still the one on the losing end. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "This is a copy of the letter I sent to the agency in question XX/XX/XXXX o whom it may concern, My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am hereby registering a formal complaint against employees of the firm Linebarger, Goggan, Blair and Scoggins. \n\nXXXX XXXX, a paralegal, and a XXXX XXXX, Texas Bar number XXXX. \n\nOn XXXX XXXX, I had a conversation with XXXX XXXX about XXXX that I initiated. I have some unpaid tolls that I need to address. I called last week and left a message, and was following up on it. In my discussion with XXXX XXXX, she was rude, unprofessional, and threatening. Informing me that if I used the tollway for any reason i would be arrested for trespassing and that i was committing a crime every time i got on the tollway. When I told her I was calling to just get something worked out, she told me my balance was some XXXX dollars. I did n't agree with this balance, and told her that i had worked out a settlement with them in XX/XX/XXXX. She pulled the record 's and told me that I did n't finish the agreement. When I asked what can be worked out, she stayed she could take a credit card for the balance. I stated I could not do that, and wanted to make arrangements, and a possible settlement. She stated she could do around XXXX. I informed her i could make some monthly payments, and she reminded me again that i had been committing a class c misdemeanor every time i drove- whether it was on the tollway, or not. When i asked to speak to her supervisor, I was told that she was not available. She insisted that she would have to call me back. The experience worth XXXX XXXX was horrible. All I want to do is try and get this worked out. \n\nXXXX XXXX called me back and left a message on my voice mail, and I returned her call. The experience with with the attorney was even more horrid than the previous call. When I called back, XXXX XXXX answered the call, I asked for the attorney, and she answered on speaker phone. I asked if we could have a private conversation, and she refused, stating that XXXX XXXX was her paralegal, and anything I had to say could be said in front of her. Since I wanted to file a complaint against XXXX XXXX, I did n't feel comfortable speaking on a speaker phone. I again requested that we have a private conversation, and the attorney refused. She was also very rude and unprofessional. She refused to take me of speaker phone. When I then asked for her supervisor, she informed me that his name was XXXX XXXX and that he was not in either. She stated she would email him a message and the call ended. \nI then received a rude, abrasive voice mail from her stating that XXXX XXXX would be out of the office until Thursday and '' that is all '' in a rude condescending tone. \n\nI recognize that I have some violations and I initiated contact to try and attempt to resolve these issues. Treating me like some third class citizen, and is actively committing crime is a disgraceful way to address this. \n\n\nAlso, according to their website, they are governed by the FDCPA, and at no time during any of my conversations, did they advise me of my Mini Miranda rights, or that they were communicating from a debt collector. They have also threatened criminal prosecution, and arrest, which are also violations. \n\n\nThey have, therefore, violated my consumer rights and are subject to serious penalties. \n\nI really would like to try and resolve this amicably if possible. I will request however that I deal with another attorney in their firm who can hold a conversation with class and dignity, and stay within the confines of the law.",

Despite numerous calls and emails, I have not gotten a response, and my call this morning was actually hung up on mid converstaion.",

I 'm monitoring my credit report constantly, and recently found out that Chase Freedom Credit Card placed negative information on my credit report, stating that I was over 30 days late with my payment of {$78.00}. I recently moved, and did n't receive billing statements from Chase to my new address, and was n't aware of the payment due. \nI notified the post office about my move, but never received anything from Chase. \nI know that before placing my account in past due status, and reporting to Credit Bureaus, creditors usually try to contact clients by phone and or email. Chase Freedom has both : my phone number, and email, but never tried to contact me. When I found out about negative info on my credit report, I immediately contacted Chase, and paid full balance to them. I asked them to remove negative information from my credit report, but they said that they will credit me the late fee, considering my excellent paying record, but refused to remove negative information from my credit report. I feel that Chase made an error by not contacting me using other means available to them, and need to fix it by retrieving the negative entry from my credit report. \nI 'm in the process of applying for loan, and this negative entry reduced my credit score by XXXX points.",

I said yes and they said we can not continue. Why did they not ask this at the beginning. They advised me to take the home off the market which I did for 6 months. Then 6 months later, we started again, had the appraisal redone and then they declined me because I had business expenses on my American express and my income could not validate the charges. I have been a XXXX for 16 years and have had my XXXX since XXXX with no late payments. I get reimbursed for business expenses. They declined me again and I put the house back on the market. I voiced a complaint several times and they would not contact until I threatened to make a formal complaint. Then they said we need additional info to process the mortgage and I gave it. Then they said we can not refinance when your home is on the market. take it off the market again for 6 months. This has been a bait and switch since the start and cost me money and time I do n't have. BOA is so unprofessional. Now over a year later my re-fi still has not been done. Not to mention I had to XXXX them every step of the way to get anything done. I think they did not want to give me the lower rate at all. They are happy to trap me in at their higher rate. \n",

The XXXX mile four year warranty was really only a XXXX mile four year warranty. The sales persons were deceptive and not looking out for the customer and more focused on commission of the sale. After nearly four years I still owe more than the original sticker price of the car. The car needs major repair but the warranty is expired. They refuse to offer refinance option to make the car more reasonably affordable. It may take four more years to pay off a car that has started to fall apart. I am unable to purchase a dependable car because of this terrible contract with them. I feel like I was trapped into a bad contract. This contract is forcing me into filing bankruptcy as an only alternative. \n",

' When they did a hard pull, which was indeed authorized by myself, taking into account that they 'd ignore the fraudulent inquiries shown as 'disputed ' for 10 days BEFORE I APPLIED. They did a hard pulling and declined me because of solely being a victim of identity theft. This raises a legal issue of discrimination as it is certainly not my fault that my identity got stolen. If at any time prior to the hard pull, was I aware of they intentionally declining me prior to this, I would n't made the application and damage by report. Other lenders have previously issued me credit, DESPITE THE FRAUDULENT INQUIRIES as they knew I have n't done them myself per the fraud alert which you can see by soft pulling. I believe reason to believe that this is intentional and I would like to seek legal remedies to have the Best Buy Citi Bank Inquiry removed from my XXXX Credit Report. \n\nI have opened at least XXXX credit card accounts : XXXX and XXXX XXXX with both of the creditors being aware of inquiries on my credit report. \n",

This cause my XXXX bill to go unpaid and my account to be in suspension. When asked to send a letter to the merchant to exhort me and state that it was a bank error, they categorically declined my request by saying it is not bank protocol to send out letters to merchant of any sorts. \n\nIssue # 2- Same Chase Bank erroneously sent my water bill payment to my address. I called them to notify them of the error and they could not pinpoint how such error came about and suggested to put a stop payment on the check although the check was in my possession. I informed the representative with whom I was on the phone that I would report to the bank in the morning to return the check and get the funds back on my account. Upon my arrival, the director informed me that no such thing could be done because of the stop payment placed on the check. I had to wait 5 days for the process to take place before funds can reflect back on my account. Again, their action placed my water payment in delinquency status. Chase Bank, again failed to take action for their wrong doing and refused to honor me with a letter explaining the error committed by the bank. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "On Thursday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 I initiated my first Credit Report Dispute with Equifax XXXX XXXX ) resulting from the findings of my first XXXX Credit Report Dispute over the \" Unfair Reporting Practices of XXXX XXXX ''. On Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 I received an email notice dated Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 informing me that XXXX XXXX had responded to my dispute. The Dispute Results where that XXXX XXXX CONTESTED my first Equifax Dispute ( XXXX ) even after the way they responded to CFPB Case XXXX. This action prompted me to establish a timeline of event since XXXX XXXX first response to CFPB. The first portion of this time line was to establish the dates XXXX XXXX responded to the various preexisting and ongoing disputes ( aka the normal dispute process laid out by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ). The second portion of this timeline was to determine when each Credit Reporting Agency received the XXXX XXXX XXXX, AUD # XXXX previously referred to by XXXX XXXX as their \" Final Solution '' to ultimately removing their fraudulent account from my Credit Report. All but one responded to me with the fact that none of them had ever received this form and one of them even said \" it 's just not done that way ''. On Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 I also generated my second Equifax Dispute ( XXXX ) this time online so I could upload documents. I supplied Equifax with the PDF file from the first CFPB case XXXX including the notorious XXXX XXXX XXXX, AUD # XXXX. This would be the only occasion any major Credit Reporting Agency would receive this form and I sent it to them myself. Although later Equifax would claim they received it from XXXX XXXX on Saturday, XXXX XXXX, 2016. At this point XXXX XXXX some how managed to shutdown the entire dispute process across the board. It 's like they stomped on the Fair Credit Reporting Act with a big boot. Everything stopped. I had to threaten XXXX with a CFPB complaint of their own if they did n't provide me with my Dispute Results before they would comply. Equifax has entrenched themselves in what can only be described as the loyalty to what is XXXX XXXX corruption. To this day they will tell me on the phone that there is no XXXX account on my Credit Report but I have never received the printed results of my second Equifax dispute. According to the table my second Equifax Dispute is still PENDING with a past estimated completion date. The estimated completion date of my second dispute was originally set for the same day I generated the dispute Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, 2016. Then it became the next day Wednesday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 until Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 when it changed to Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 and it has been that date until now. Since Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 XXXX XXXX has managed to CONTEST my first Equifax Credit Dispute, block me from receiving my Dispute Results temporarily from XXXX and permanently from Equifax and has impersonated me by using my previous contact information and with the help of XXXX, Equifax and XXXX applied a flap of Unauthorized Fraud Alerts ( UFA 's ) added to my credit reports ( XXXX in all, so far ) so much that I think they warrant their own CFPB Cases. To this day I can login to see a table of all my confirmation numbers but I have no way of seeing my Dispute Results for my second Equifax dispute. I believe Equifax is involved in large measure violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act themselves in this game of Fraud Alerts they continue to play on behalf of XXXX XXXX. My next CFPB case on Equifax will be about these Unauthorized Fraud Alerts ( UFA 's ) and titled Equifax XXXX.",

I was told no and basically that I was irresponsible for letting the card go over its limit. I asked them to state that as a Citi repr they would not help us with the payment, I was again told I was irresponsible. I was n't asking to remove the debt, just to have a payment that was manageable. We have made every payment on time for years and were treated horribly at a time we needed to the help. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "In XXXX of 2015, I applied for a mortgage refinance loan with Pentagon Federal Credit Union, the same way as which I had done with the same company for the same loan account in the past. Within a couple days, I was contacted by a representative who gathered additional information and started the process. Soon after I was sent a \" Good Faith '' statement which had estimated settlement charges of {$6100.00}. A few weeks went by and I heard nothing. I contacted the loan processor who e-mailed me a request for several documents ( 2 years of federal tax returns, pays stubs, bank account info, ect ... ). I provided the documents. Many weeks went by again without PenFed contacting me. I contacted the loan processor to inquire about the status. The processor stated she had difficulty opening the documents that I sent even though they were sent in the exact same format as documents the processor had sent to me. After sending the same requested documents several different ways, the processor advised me that the they were able to open them and everything was fine. A week passed without contact and I contacted the processor regarding the status. She stated that I needed to contact their title company. I responded that their title company should be contacting me because I had no Idea of who they used. On XXXX XXXX, I received a call from the title company they had decided to use ( PenFed XXXX, XXXX ). That representative stated that they could not see where I had paid off a mortgage loan from XXXX XXXX Loans for the same house 10 years ago. I advised them that I had refinanced the home twice before with PenFed and this issue had never come up. They stated they had problems in the past with documents not being filed correctly during PenFed 's restructuring and their documents regarding my previous loans with them may have been lost. I was asked by the rep. to produce a document from 10 years ago. I advised them that I did n't have those documents. They stated they would continue their search. more weeks passed. On XXXX XXXX, I again sent my loan processor an e-mail regarding the status. I soon after received a \" Good Faith '' statement with a different estimated settlement charges of {$8200.00} for me to review and sign during closing. No other correspondence was sent regarding when and where closing would take place nor the extra {$2100.00} increase in estimated settlement charges. If anything, you 'd think this amount would have gone down! I again e-mailed the processor. On XXXX XXXX, I received a phone call from the PenFed processor 's supervisor who stated the delay in my refinance was because of the title company not being able to verify that I had paid off the home loan originally with XXXX 10 years ago. I advised the supervisor that I had refinanced the same home loan on twice before with PenFed within that 10 years and had never had this issue come up. The supervisor stated that they are stricter now an in the past they probably just looked the other way, but they cant do that now and if I ca n't come up with the document ( Certificate of Satisfaction ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX showing the original loan was satisfied, PenFed would not be able to refinance my loan. I replied to the supervisor that it sounded more like PenFed did not want to give me the loan because I locked in at a lower rate and the government just raised interest rates. This ordeal is still continuing and we are now approaching 4 months! In the past it has only taken a couple weeks to do a refinance with the same company. PenFed. Are there not a time limit that governs institutions with processing these type of loans??? \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "My Issue is with Sallie Mae I have XXXX student loans with this lender and XXXX of them have problems. The XXXX XXXX is for an original principal amount of {$16000.00} which was cosigned by my mother and XXXX is a {$3000.00} loan that covered XX/XX/XXXX semester. XX/XX/XXXX I received a Final notice of Default for the loan cosigned by my mother. I then called in to the collection agent who gave me XXXX choices. Garnishment for both me and mom, My Mother could settle the debt outright for about {$11000.00}, or I could pay {$5000.00} down and {$100.00} a month until the Loan Balance was paid down. Since neither I or my parents had those kinds of assets readily available, and since the Representative used in My opinion Illegal Scare tactics and attempted to seek my mother 's retirement assets and assets held in Joint accounts from my father, I decided to consult an attorney. In the presence of my attorney, We called XX/XX/XXXX ( I forgot the exact date ), and we called the collections Agent back. She even had the Gull to ask If I was not liquid, How was it that I could afford an attorney I did not answer, but I opt for legal insurance through my job. My attorney informed the collections Agent that my parents were not liquid and I did not have the access to cash and we negotiated a deal whereby I would pay {$2000.00} down and {$100.00} a month for the life of the loan. In this phone call I specifically asked the Rep if this would apply to XXXX LOANS and she said YES! Well It did not. XX/XX/XXXX, I began receiving Collections calls again.I called in in XX/XX/XXXX ( Or XX/XX/XXXX ) To try and put a stop to it. I Informed them of the deal that was reached and that the rep had said that it applied to XXXX loans. The Manager I spoke to then said that it was Impossible to apply the deal to XXXX loans even after she reviewed the record of the call and that the {$3000.00} loan was still delinquent. I said that she was going back on her word and that I refused to pay because I did not have the resources and because Sallie Mae Gave their word and now they went back on it. I wanted to go back to my attorney to deal with this, but doing so requires taking time off of work I can not afford, as I am out of vacation/sick time for the year. So far I have not responded to them since XX/XX/XXXX and I have a log of XXXX Voicemail from Sallie Mae Collections Agents. The calls begin on XX/XX/XXXX and the last VM I received was at XXXX. they call at all hours of the day and quite frankly this is Harassment. How many Man hours and how much money has Sallie Mae spend trying to collect this Debt? I want them to keep their Original Word that the Settlement reached Would Encompass XXXX Loans. I have paid as agreed so far and kept my end of the deal, but Sallie Mae has not kept their end. I furthermore want Sallie Mae to remove ALL derogatory remarks from my Credit report concerning both these loans. The last thing I want is for an immediate end to all collections calls and letters.",

    "complaint_what_happened": "Due to a recent ( successful ) credit card application, I received a notice that I could get a free credit report within 60 days. The notice gave a phone no. for Experian ( XXXX ) which I called. After answering the prompts on the phone tree, I got a message that said if I did n't have internet access, to stay on the line to get a report mailed to me. I waited and the message cycled through 3 times then said something like, \" I 'm sorry you 're having trouble. Pls try again later. Goodbye. '' I called again and this time, pressed \" XXXX '' at that same point, which was for people who wanted their free annual report. ( Since I was n't trying to get that, well, I did n't know if it was the same thing or not, I did n't go that direction on my first pass. ) So, from \" XXXX '', I got a message that said to go to the website and, eventually, ended the call, similar to the first time. ( One of the options in the phone tree was for those who had received a negative response to a credit application. I did n't go that route because I had received a positive response. ) The bottom line is that Experian says they will mail you a copy of your credit report and that you can order it by phone but then, it does not let you do that. Now, I came over to a relative 's house to use the computer and went to Experian.com, where they list a 2nd number to call ( XXXX ). I did so and got the exact same phone tree and the exact same recordings that led nowhere. It was the same as the first time, I called and pressed \" XXXX '' and waited there until they hung up on me, called back and pressed \" XXXX '' until they, again, hung up on me. \nLuckily, for me, I have fairly reliable computer access, so it 's not a big deal but what does someone with no access to computers do? Experian 's phone response is all automated, so it 's impossible to actually talk to anyone and ask questions, get help, etc. Experian is not servicing our consumer community as it purports to nor is it servicing us as I understand it is obliged to by law. What do you think? \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "Let me be clear. I have paid all my mortgage payments in full, to date. I bought my home in XXXX and immediately set up automatic direct debit every XXXX of the month to the mortgage company, XXXX XXXX. Sometime in XXXX, my loan was sold to Citibank, who expected a XXXX payment. I immediately contacted Citi, who assured me they would recover the funds from the previous lender. When this did not occur, I contacted XXXX XXXX, and was told the date, amount and tracking number of the wire transfer. I called Citibank, but still nothing. I made a very long conference call with the two, ( XXXX from Citi and XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX ). The Citi rep recorded the info of the transaction. XXXX also sent the info. Still nothing. Citi told me to fax my bank statement. They must have given me the wrong number as I spent about an hour faxing to a bad number. I repeatedly called Citi, which is always very time consuming and sometimes even impossible to connect. On one occasion, they informed me they had found some of my mortgage payment, but not all, and therefore would apply none. ( They would have never revealed this info, if I had n't asked ). Becoming increasingly aggravated, I told them, recovering the rest of this payment and the associated discrepancies is beyond my ability. I merely pay my bills and as I had no control over this transaction, Citi will have to find my money. I have helped as much as I can. Rather than directing their energies to finding the mortgage payment I made on XXXX XXXX, they have instead chosen to harass and threaten me. They call me at work, on vacation, ( verbally abusive ) send me threatening letters, to foreclose on my home, damage my credit rating, which would seriously jeopardize my job. I have spent so much time trying to solve what I consider their problem, and now they expect me to take time from work to meet them. I called a local branch to try to set up a meeting but was unable to get through. If there is a problem with XXXX XXXX, why am I in the middle? It 's not my field, I 've told them, repeatedly. They bought the loan and the associated payments. My job is very important to me, and right now I am way too bogged down, to get further involved in and stressed out correcting Citi 's incompetency and misconduct. In fact, when I do have time, I will look into getting this note into the hands of a more professional and respectful lender. ( By the way, the missing money amounts to about {$250.00}, which really does not justify Citi 's hostile behavior. ) \n",

I have a Discover card that has a Cashback Bonus Program Terms and Conditions that reads : \" You will earn a full XXXX % Cashback Bonus on your first {$250.00} in combined gas and restaurant purchases ( \" G & R Purchases '' ) that are posted to your Account each pilling period. At the end of each billing period, we calculate your Cashback Bonus by multiplying your first {$250.00} in G & R Purchases by XXXX % ( XXXX ) and all other G & R Purchases by up to XXXX % ( XXXX ) ( see \" All Other Purchases '' section. \" Gas '' purchases are those made at merchant locations where the primary business is the sale of gasoline. \" Restaurant '' purchases are those made at merchants classified as full service restaurants, cafes, cafeterias and fast food locations. Purchases coded for category other than those listed above will not qualify. \n\nWell, I can look at my last statement and see that Discover is classifying a distinct and well known GAS STATION as a Supermarket so they do n't have to award the required bonus points. The merchant is a XXXX XXXX. If you look at the XXXX page for XXXX the very first line reads, \" XXXX XXXX is a chain of gasoline and convenience stores in the United States ''. XXXX is clearly a merchant primarily gas station. I do n't know many people that use a XXXX as Supermarket over a Gas Station. I believe the Discover is trying to trick customers into thinking that they these purchases will qualify for the noted Gas and Restaurant Purchases, but are miss coded and will not award them. They hope customers wo n't catch this so they can reap the benefits from these transactions. \n\nDiscover has the ability to code certain merchants for bonus programs. For instance, I have another Discover card that is running a rewards promotion that offers \" XXXX % Cashback Bonus at Home Improvement Stores & at XXXX on up to {$1500.00} in Purchase ''. So Discover already has the ability to code a merchant ( i.e. XXXX ) to fit into a bonus category. I suggest that Discover add the gas station merchants to their gas station database so the bonus rewards as awarded to customers accordingly. I believe that Discover is purposely not awarding the gas station awards to customers in accordance with the card agreement so they do n't have to pay as much. They were just hoping that customers, like myself, would not noticed that they are not actually awarding the rewards when they make gas purchased. \n\nAdditionally, I would like my account reviewed and all the past gas station rewards that were not awarded in the past to be added to my account. I am sure that I am missing a great deal of rewards that were not rewarded to be because of this misclassification by Discover. And I am guessing that many other customers have also be cheated on the cashback bonus program by Discover.",

At that time the balance was already paid by the title company involved in the re-finance, this resulted in a negative balance. \nXXXX County taxes were paid in the amount of {$60.00}, as this was the difference due following the XXXX over payment and change in XXXX XXXX rate. \nXXXX/XXXX/XXXX 360 Mortgage Group conducted an escrow analysis and determined that the Consumers ' taxes would only be {$120.00} for XXXX, subsequently they issued an escrow refund to consumers for {$1800.00}. \no Please notes : tax history going back to XXXX is average at {$3000.00}. This should have raised a red flag to 360 Mortgage Group. \nXXXX/XXXX/XXXX an annual escrow account disclosure statement was sent to consumers indicating that the escrow account was severely deficient at a shortage of {$3200.00} which was to be prorated over 12 months at {$270.00} and would raise the payment of {$1400.00} by {$540.00} to {$1900.00}. \nXXXX/XXXX/XXXX Consumer contacted 360 Mortgage Group and spoke with XXXX who advised her that the taxes were only {$120.00} last year and now they were {$3300.00}. He advised that taxes are calculated based on the previous tax year, which does not make sense as the XXXX tax year had a tax bill of {$3300.00}, nowhere near {$120.00}. XXXX assured consumer that a supervisor, XXXX would call her back by 2 business days or Tuesday XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Consumer asked that this matter be resolved and based on 360 Mortgage Group serious error that they make financial amends for this mistake. \nXXXX/XXXX/XXXX No call received from the supervisor XXXX. I called and spoke with XXXX who passed me to the supervisor XXXX. XXXX advised that they will spread the escrow payment over 36 months and this will result in a payment of {$1700.00} as of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and increase of {$360.00}. I requested a call back from a manager several times and she refused and stated that she was all I was going to get and \" managers do n't take calls. '' I advised her that I would accept the 36 months but am still asking 360 Mortgage Group to resolve this financially based on their mistake. This puts a huge financial burden on the home owner of a payment increase of {$360.00}. I again repeated my request for a call back and appropriate resolution to XXXX, but as the call was going in circle with her, I had no choice but to end the call. \nXXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX statement received showing payment due XXXX/XXXX/XXXX {$1900.00}. This was never resolved and now the consumers ' payment is increasing by {$540.00}, which is an impossible burden.",

    "complaint_what_happened": "On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I was approved for a Bank of America ( BOA ) XXXX XXXX account with a leased XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Before signing the contract, the BOA representative who opened the account stated there was a Buyer 's Remorse period during which I could return the unit without fees anytime before the beginning of the first lease period, which was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. He also indicated in multiple phone calls that my processing fees were 1.69 % plus XXXX cents per swipe for XXXX and XXXX, 2.13 % plus XXXX cents per swipe for XXXX XXXX, and a XXXX cents flat fee per swipe for all debit cards. He stated that there were no other fees and these were the lowest in the industry such as when compared to XXXX, which has a 2.75 % flat processing fee for all card types. He also stated that holding an active XXXX XXXX account would waive the monthly fees on the Business Checking account held with Bank of America. I agreed to these terms and received the unit. However, I was not satisfied with the experience, and wished to return everything before the lease began. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I contacted my BOA representative and he told me to contact XXXX XXXX. I contacted XXXX, who told me my lease had already begun on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and I would be responsible for paying nearly {$3000.00} to pay off the lease even if I returned the device. I called BOA back and told my representative, who was shocked and stated that the lease clearly should not have begun until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and that he would speak to his manager about doing a buyback to resolve the issue. The buyback was approved, and I shipped the device to BOA with XXXX overnight shipping. However, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I noticed a withdrawal from my checking account for the amount of {$62.00}, labeled lease payment. I attempted to contact BOA multiple times regarding this charge, and was largely ignored until the XXXX attempt, when they said I would need to contact XXXX to get the fee refunded. I am still in the process of trying to get that fee refunded. In addition, I looked at my merchant statements for the payments I had processed, and found that I was charged many fees in addition to the fees described earlier. For example, it was definitely not a {$0.00} flat fee to process debit cards, I calculated it out to be more like 1.5 %. In addition, the statements are complicated and designed to be confusing and difficult to reconcile. Finally, I was also charged a {$29.00} monthly fee for my Business Checking account, which was supposed to be waived. When I complained about these hidden fees to BOA, they told me to contact XXXX regarding the processing fees. I feel that I was deceived and misled from the beginning that BOA XXXX XXXX would have the lowest fees in the industry, and have found reality to be completely contrary. \n",

What????? SPS wrote us and said \" we would extend the sale date 30 days but your sale date is XXXX, XXXX '' although they said that all paperwork was complete to get a loan modification. THIS IS DUAL TRACKING and is violating my Homeowner 's Bill of Rights and a violation of the law. This is a company that had done a lot of violations and has cost much damage. Here are the Bullet points of illegal behavior and I have XXXX inches of documents to back up each point that I can send to you. Take note that this company SPS has violated federal law by making an inquiry of my credit report without my authorization. This is a violation of the FCRA as well. Above stated property was fully reconveyed in late XXXX, early XXXX. The following are pages of evidence to show this fact. We as a family are very concerned about the actions taken by SPS ( Select Portfolio Servicing inc. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , Utah , XXXX. ) as they are threatening to take our property. They did not give us a XXXX either even after they indicated that the file was complete. Eight months now, we have been dragged around by this unethical and abusive company. I believe that there has been an abuse of authority and that there is grave danger to Homeowners as well as the United States. I have been lied to and purposefully misled as well as multiple violation made by Select Portfolio Servicing ( and non-disclosed affiliates with SPS ) against me that I believe with the evidence of intentional negligence by SPS et.al and I need protection under the Whistle Blower Protection Act. I also have intimate, and actual knowledge of these illegal actions, still occurring concealment and unfair and I can expose the how major institutions are taking advantage of Americans. About 8 months ago I began to receive letters from SPS attempting to collect a debt. What debt? I own my home! They were aggressive and persistent and intimidated me with threats of taking my home. This was absurd and I was frightened. After months of letters and calls back and forth and getting SPS the documents they demanded, they now want to foreclose on my home XXXX XXXX, XXXX. And now XXXX XXXX, as they keep postponing it. I was told by SPS through written Communication ( XXXX XXXX letter ) and Verbally several times that the loan is Complete, for Modification with Principle Reduction down below the valuation conducted by SPS ( Affiliates/Silent Partners including : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, ETC. ) in late XXXX. XXXX Title 12 Code of Federal Regulations, sections 226. 18 ( j ) 31 USC : 1901, USC : 1901, Etc. ( Please refer to the Accepted Certified Letter acknowledged XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.

Since both have different numbers someone has failed in fully investigating. There have been numerous phone calls with Experian supervisors who agree the reporting has to be incorrect but they never change it and any dispute comes back as verified My belief is that the credit bureaus have failed to investigate and XXXX XXXX XXXX has deliberately reported incorrectly to punatively keep this item on my credit reports beyond the mandated 7 year reporting period.

That representation turned out to be false. \n\nMoreover, only four months earlier, Citibank, N.A., issued me a new Visa platinum card purportedly the period of XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX. That representation turned out to be false. \n\nThe \" notice of account closure '' dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, indicated in bold letters \" We 're sorry we were n't the right fit ''. \nThis followed other written representations from Citibank, N.A., regarding my account : \" Thank you for being a loyal card member since XXXX! We appreciate your business and are continually looking for ways to make your relationship with us as rewarding as possible. '' and \" Thank you for being a valuable AT & T Universal platinum Card member. '' and \" No annual fee for life.

I received no written reply from any Citibank entity, and only a telephone call from someone who told me that my letter to XXXX XXXX was forwarded to him, and I could apply for a new account. It is unprofessional and inappropriate for Citibank, N.A., not to have responded in writing, and not in any way to have addressed my claim of unfair and deceptive acts in administering and closing my account. \n\nThe purported reason for closing the account was inactivity. However, I pointed out to XXXX XXXX something that should be abundantly clear to a card executive : that the nature of revolving credit involves periods of inactivity and zero balance. Citibank , N.A . 's written communications with me have been dishonest, and Citibank, N.A., has been dishonest and unfair in closing my account of 25 years, a period of time during which I rejected many other card companies ' offers of credit because I had this particular Citibank, N.A., account. \n\nWhereas Citibank, N.A., stated that I was a valued customer for life, it turns out that I was really unwanted, expendable, and not even worth a written response. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "My home is being auctioned off by Trinity Financial LLC in XXXX XXXX, Ca. My loan with XXXX during the time I modified my loan during the year XXXX is period of modification. I had XXXX & XXXX loan. Representative of XXXX told me that XXXX was charged off & there 's only XXXX loan to pay. Once XXXX approved & modified my loan, few months later they notified me via mail the loan was sold to XXXX XXXX & would be servicing my loan now. I was told clearly by XXXX XXXX no longer existed since it was charged off. Once sold to XXXX I continued to pay ON TIME on mortgage payments. To my shock I kept receiving mail from investors and lawyers to help my save my home. I called XXXX they said they were not foreclosing on my home. I found out that this bottom feeder investor company Trinity Financial was foreclosing on my home. How is it legal for this company to foreclose on are home for the XXXX loan. They never notified me or gave me any warning they were foreclosing. Trinity said that we had by XXXX XXXX to contact them to resolve this matter. They requested my financial information which I complied gave them all they needed. Once they received my financial info & felt I ca n't afford to pay what they are asking they cut all contact and put a sale date to auction my phone off by XX/XX/XXXX. Trinity Financial had no intention to try and work with us they had full intention to foreclose and sale my home. There is this boom in Real Estate now where there are bottom feeder investors like Trinity Financial purchases charged off unsecured loans & sits on them for a few years if the house is upside down and wait till the market goes up & the home gains equity then they go after homeowners and I am a victim of this. Trinity Financial has NEVER made attempts to reach out to notify me that they purchased the loan. Do n't homeowners have the right to know who purchased the loan so they know who to make payments to. They sat on the loan for 2 years then they foreclosed then notified me & now are trying to auction my home. Trinity financial requested my financial info from me, made me believe they wanted to work with me. Come to find out they just wanted to see what we can afford then STOPPED all contact with me. When I called the office to speak to XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX I was told not to attempt to contact them. I would have to contact their lawyer XXXX XXXX XXXX which I did to confirm they received my financial info & thats when he stopped taking my calls. Not the attorney nor XXXX XXXX President of company nor XXXX XXXX the loss mortgage manager would speak to me. How am I suppose to resolve this if they wo n't speak with me. I personally wrote XXXX XXXX a letter asking to work me & received no response. They only option they gave me is to pay XXXX or home will be auctioned off. I hired lawyer to speak to their lawyer to resolve this & their lawyer wo n't respond to my lawyer calls. XXXX XXXX president of Trinity Financial prides himself on there website that Trinity Financial purchases assets or unsecured loan of pools of non-performing second mortgages with expectations of converting a high percentage to performing status. Trinity says it achieves this by BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS & WORKING CLOSELY W/HOMEOWhichWNERS through variety of workout options including modifications & settlements yet they 've done none of these w/me except have NO communication with me nor accept my calls to Trinity or their lawyer. Under the law ( XXXX ) requires party listed ( Trinity ) to validate the right & authority to foreclose before recording notice of default. I have reason to believe that Trinity has any legal right to collect loan payment & /or to initiate foreclosure/auction proceedings. Under Calif law, only \" holder '' in possession of original endorsed note has legal right to auction home. Their in material violation. \n",

I received via the XXXX website a completed wire conformation with the the federal reference number. On Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2016 I contacted Ally Bank since the money was still not in my Ally savings account. The service rep at Ally showed no pending wire transfer activity and also checked with their wire department at my request. They found no activity. \nThis same day I contacted XXXX and they said their records reflected that the {$18000.00} was delivered to Ally Bank. I then asked and XXXX agreed to arrange a conference call with Ally Bank to try and determine the cause of the problem. We confirmed the that the routing number and account number were correct. We ended the conversation with Ally Bank, since they still showed no money transfer activity from XXXX into my account ( at AllyBank ). \nXXXX was very helpful and said they would try and find out what happened and if Ally Bank had rejected the transfer, it would take XXXX days from XXXX XXXX for XXXX to see it. The XXXX management rep said he would pursue it further and would call me in the afternoon of the next day. \nThe next day XXXX XXXX, 2016, XXXX contacted me and said Ally Bank had in a fact rejected the transfer. I was told that the apparent reason for the rejection stated, unable to apply to account due to incorrect routing number and or account number. We had already confirmed that all the routing and account numbers were correct- so the reason for the rejection was incorrect. That same day XXXX sent another wire of {$18000.00} which was delivered into my account on XXXX XXXX, 2016. \nI again called Ally Bank and spoke to another supervisor who took my information and gave me a case # XXXX. He still could n't provide me with why the original transfer had rejected back to XXXX. I also sent an email to Ally bank customer service yesterday ( XXXX XXXX ) and indicted that if I did n't get an answer today, I would write to the CFPB. As of the writing I 've received no reply. \n\nAll I want to know as I 've asked Ally Bank repeatedly is what was the actual reason my money wire was rejected and for them to reassure me that It would not happen again. As I mentioned to Ally Bank I had to use money from other sources because the money was not in my account on XXXX XXXX, 2016. Please help get an answer. I 've received no help at all from their customer service or customer disservice in this case. Thank you for your help. \n",

    "complaint_what_happened": "I received a letter of threat that I had 15 days from the date of a letter to pay a debt or they would file suit against me in court. The company then I called and they said I had 15 days to pay or they would send me a confession of judement in order to keep this out of court. I then told them I wanted all paperwork of verification sent to me and I would make a payment of I believe {$140.00} till I could see what this was about. I never received anything but a confession of judgement. I then set up a payment plan over the phone with them and sent the papers back. I emailed them and requested through many calls to get copies of the paperwork and bills to prove the amount. Still nothing. When my payment date came up I called to make a payment they denied me that opportunity said they never reeived the signed copy of the confession of judgement and then said they had already filed the lawsuit with the court. I said you never sent me anything in the mail or called to tell me you did n't get the paperwork. They said the only thing to do is sign a consent judgement. I then had the FTC on the phone with a recorded conversation of them dening me the option to pay. And also me requesting to have the verification documents sent to me. They still did nothing. I have yet to get any verification and they went ahead and said that I denied the service papers to the court when I was never served with papers at all. I sent them a consent to judgement because they threatened me numerous times on taking my paycheck which is only {$350.00} every 2 weeks. I have never receivec any proof of the amount owed on this debt and have around 10 emails asking for the proof and them responding. With what proof to you need. I said bills transactions. They told me that it was around XXXX pages but will not send anything. I was tricked into signing papers for consents and confessions by them and this was all in a 2 month time frame. I even sent them a 20th email stating that I will pay a settlememt of {$500.00} with proof of the debt they denied a settlkement offer. This company needs to be stopped. \n",
